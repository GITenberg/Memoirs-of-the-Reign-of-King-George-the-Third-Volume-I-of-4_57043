<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Memoirs of the Reign of King George
the Third</span>, by Horace Walpole (Earl of Orford),
now for the first time submitted to the Public, are
printed from a manuscript copy contained in the box
of papers which came into the possession of the late
Earl of Waldegrave, under the circumstances stated
in the Preface to “The Memoires of the Last Twelve
Years of the Reign of George the Second.” This
manuscript was placed by Lord Waldegrave in the
hands of the late Lord Holland at the same time
with “the Memoires” last mentioned, and hopes
were long entertained that it would have had the
advantage of the editorial care which gave so much
additional interest to that work; but from the date
of Lord Holland’s return to office, in 1830, the little
leisure he could find for literary pursuits was diverted
from these volumes by engagements of a more press<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>ing
character; and it appeared at his death that he
had never even commenced the task which he was
of all persons eminently qualified to execute. Under
these circumstances Lord Euston (now Duke of
Grafton) on whom the property of the manuscript
had devolved, as Lord Waldegrave’s executor, became
very desirous that the publication should no
longer be deferred; and happening to consult me
on the subject, my interest was so much excited
by a cursory perusal, that I acceded to the request
made to me to prepare the Work for the press.
In this I was further encouraged by the assurance I
received of the zealous co-operation and assistance of
the late Mr. John Allen, whose knowledge of the early
years of George the Third’s reign was surpassed by
none of his contemporaries (excepting, perhaps, Lord
Holland), and whose participation in all the studies,
and I might almost add identification with the literary
pursuits of that nobleman, would have given me many
of the advantages I should have derived from himself,
had he been still living. I had several conversations
with Mr. Allen on the plan to be pursued
in editing the Work, and his hints on the characters
of the individuals described in it were of essential
service to me; but unhappily, before my labours
had commenced in earnest, he was taken ill, and in a
few days followed his friend and patron to the grave.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
Few of the associates of his latter days valued him
more than myself, or more deeply regretted his loss;
and in revising these pages, my mind has often recurred
with melancholy yet grateful satisfaction to the many
agreeable and most instructive hours I have passed in
his and Lord Holland’s society at a house which has
acquired an European celebrity as the great point of
intellectual and moral reunion among the most distinguished
political and literary men of the present
century.</p>

<p>These Memoirs comprise the first twelve years of
the reign of George the Third, and close the historical
works of Horace Walpole. “On their merits,” to use
the words of Lord Holland,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> “it would be improper
to enlarge in this place. That they contain much
curious and original information, will not be disputed.”
In common with the Memoires of George the Second,
“they treat of a part of our annals most imperfectly
known to us,” with the decided advantage of the
period being one marked by events of deeper interest
and more congenial in their character and bearings
with those which have since engaged, and still occupy
our attention. The contests between Whigs and
Jacobites may not be undeserving our curiosity; yet
they sink into insignificance when compared with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
origin and progress of the American discontents, in
which may be traced the first indistinct rudiments of
the great antagonistic principles and social revolutions
of our own time. The Parliamentary struggles,
too, in the case of General Warrants, are important,
not less on account of the stores of constitutional
knowledge they elicited, than from the spirit of free
inquiry into the Prerogatives of the Crown on the
one hand and the Privileges of the People on the
other, which necessarily sprang out of them. Nor is
it an uninstructive lesson to observe the efforts
made by George the Third to break up the political
parties which had embarrassed the reign of his predecessor.
These topics are among the most prominent
in the History of England during the Eighteenth Century,
and they constitute the staple of the present
Work. Some of the best debates on the Stamp Act,
and on the proceedings against Mr. Wilkes, are here
reported with a vivacity and apparent correctness
which may be sought in vain elsewhere; and we meet
throughout the Work the same abundance of anecdote,
and the same graphic description of men and
manners, that characterise the Memoires of George the
Second. It gives even more copious details of the
negotiations between political parties, especially those
incidental to the fall of Lord Rockingham’s Administration;
the gradual alienation of that nobleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
and his friends from the Duke of Grafton; and the
other divisions among the Whig party, which ended
in the long enjoyment of power by their opponents.
The records of these transactions do not, it is true,
form the most dignified department of the historian,
but political history is necessarily incomplete
without them; and here Walpole is on his own
ground. Unlike most of the writers who have minutely
chronicled their times, he can neither be
charged with obtaining mere imperfect or occasional
glances into the councils of men in power, nor with
suffering himself to be shackled by a sense of official
restraint, not to say responsibility. He possessed entirely
the secret of affairs, at least as long as Conway
remained Minister; and so unreservedly discloses what
he knew, that he might not untruly boast, as he does
elsewhere, “that the failings of some of his nearest
friends are as little concealed as those of other persons.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>I have little to add concerning my own share in
these Memoirs. They are printed exactly as the Author
left them, except that it has been thought right
to suppress a few passages of an indecent tendency; and
following the example of Lord Holland, “two or three
passages affecting the private characters of private
persons, and in no ways connected with any political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
event, or illustrative of any great public character,
have been omitted.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The notes that occur without any distinguishing
mark were left by the Author. It will be perceived
that they seldom extend beyond a brief statement of
the rank or relationship of the individuals noticed in
the text. All the other notes are mine.</p>

<p>In compliance with a wish generally expressed
after the publication of the “Memoires of the Last
Twelve Years of the Reign of George the Second,”
for additional information respecting many of the
characters described in that work, I have enlarged
on the meagre notices left by Walpole, and endeavoured
to correct his errors—taking, as my model, the
annotations of Lord Dover and Mr. Wright on the
Author’s correspondence. My references to those popular
works will be found to have been frequent, and I
can venture to add my testimony to their impartiality
and correctness.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> I may have unconsciously borrowed
from them, where we are treating of the same individuals;
but I have endeavoured, as much as possible,
to steer an independent course, and the subject is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
sufficiently wide to admit of it. I have also carefully
consulted all the contemporary authorities within my
reach, and, in more than one instance, have received
valuable communications from persons who either lived
near the times described by Walpole, or were actually
acquainted with him. My sole object, however, has
been to contribute to the information of readers
hitherto little conversant with the events and characters
of the period under our notice. More detailed
criticism on particular transactions, and some biographical
sketches, too long for insertion in the notes,
will be given in the Appendix to the Fourth Volume;
but I have no pretensions to encroach on the province
of the historian—especially since the publication
of the last volume of Lord Mahon’s History of
George the Third, and the recent article on Lord
Chatham in the Edinburgh Review, both of which
have appeared since this Work went to the press.</p>

<p>It was at first expected that this Work would be
comprised in three volumes, but a more careful examination
of the manuscript having proved a fourth to
be indispensable, it is thought best not to delay the
publication of the two volumes already printed, and
to reserve the two concluding volumes until early in
the Spring.</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge much kindness from various
friends in the prosecution of my inquiries. Sir Edward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
Colebrooke, in particular, has favoured me with the
loan of the manuscript autobiography of his grandfather,
Sir George Colebrooke, M. P., Chairman of the
East India Company, an active politician, who lived on
confidential terms with the Duke of Newcastle, Lord
Rockingham, and Mr. Charles Townshend; and I am
indebted to Sir George Larpent for the perusal of the
papers of his father, when Secretary to Lord Hertford,
during the embassy of the latter at Paris.</p>

<p>Whoever has taken the trouble of reading my Memoirs,
which relate the transactions during the last
ten years of King George the Second, will have seen,
that I had taken a resolution of interfering no more
in public affairs. It was no ambition, or spirit of faction,
that engaged me in them again. Inconstancy, or
weariness of retirement, were as little the motives of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
my return to action. I am going to set forth the true
causes; and if I am obliged to make more frequent
mention of myself than I should wish to do, it will be
from the necessity I am under of unfolding the secret
springs of many events in which I was unwillingly a
considerable actor. It is to gratify no vanity that I
relate them: my portion was not brilliant. And
though my counsels might have been more serviceable
to my country and to my friends, if they had been
more followed, they were calculated to produce neither
glory nor profit to myself, and were much oftener
neglected than listened to. Nor should they be remembered
here, if many miscarriages had not accrued
from the neglect of them, as was felt and confessed by
those to whom they had been suggested.</p>

<p>How far I have been in the right or in the wrong,
I leave to the judgment of posterity, who shall be impartially
informed; and who may draw some benefit
from the knowledge of what I have seen; though few
persons, I believe, profit much from history. Times
seldom resemble one another enough to be very applicable;
and if they do, the characters of the actors
are very different. They, too, who read history most,
are seldom performers in the political drama. Yet they
who have performed any part in it, are at least able to
give the best account of it, though still an imperfect
one. No man is acquainted with the whole plot; as
no man knows all the secret springs of the actions of
others. His passions and prejudices warp his judgment,
and cast a mist before the most penetrating
sagacity. Yet, partial as the narratives of the actors
must be, they will certainly approach nearer to truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
than those of spectators, who, beholding nothing but
events, pretend to account for them from causes which
they can but suppose, and which frequently never existed.
It is this assistance to history which I now
offer, and by which I may explain some passages,
which might otherwise never be cleared up.</p>

<p>I have a new reason for repeating here, what I have
said in former pages, that these are memoirs, not history.
The inequality, and perhaps even the contradictory
opinions which may appear in them from being
written at different periods, forbid this work to aim at
the regular march of history. As I knew men more,
I may have altered my sentiments of them;—they
themselves may have changed. If I had any personal
causes for changing my opinion, I have told them
fairly, that the fault may be imputed to my passions,
rather than to those I speak of. The actions of the
persons must determine whether they altered, or I was
prejudiced. But, though this dissonance may cast
unequal colours on my work, I choose to leave it as I
wrote it, having at each period spoken truth as it
appeared to me. I might have made it more uniform
by correction; but the natural colouring would have
been lost; and I should rather have composed than
written a history. As it stands an original sketch, it
is at least a picture of my own mind and opinions.
That sketch may be valuable to a few, who study
human nature even in a single character.</p>

<p>But I will make no farther apology for a work
which I am sensible has many faults; which I again
declare I do not give as a history; and to which, if it
has not merits sufficient to atone for its blemishes, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
desire no quarter may be given. Remember, reader,
I offer you no more than the memoirs of men who
had many faults, written by a man who had many
himself; and who writes to inform you, not to engross
your admiration. Had he given you a perfect history,
and a flattering picture of himself, his work would
have been a romance, and he an impostor. He lived
with a contempt of hypocrisy; and writes as he lived.</p>

<p>George the Second, contradicting the silly presages
drawn from parallels, which had furnished opposition
with names of unfortunate Princes, who were the
second of their name, as Edward, Richard, Charles,
and James, terminated his career with glory both to
himself and his people. He died, crowned with years
and honours, and respected from success; which with
the multitude is the same as being beloved. He left
a successor in the vigour of youth, ready to take the
reins, and a ministry universally applauded, united, and
unembarrassed by opponents.</p>

<p>No British monarch had ascended the throne with
so many advantages as George the Third. Being the
first of his line born in England, the prejudice against
his family as foreigners ceased in his person—Hanover
was no longer the native soil of our Princes; consequently,
attachment to the Electorate was not likely
to govern our councils, as it had done in the last two
reigns. This circumstance, too, of his birth, shifted
the unpopularity of foreign extraction from the House
of Brunswick to the Stuarts. In the flower and bloom
of youth, George had a handsome, open, and honest
countenance; and with the favour that attends the
outward accomplishments of his age, he had none of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the vices that fall under the censure of those who are
past enjoying them themselves.</p>

<p>The moment of his accession was fortunate beyond
example. The extinction of parties had not waited
for, but preceded the dawn of his reign. Thus it was
not a race of factions running to offer themselves, as
is common, to a new Prince, bidding for his favour,
and ready each to be disgusted, if their antagonists
were received with more grace; but a natural devolution
of duty from all men to the uncontroverted
heir of the Crown, who had no occasion to court the
love of his subjects, nor could fear interrupting established
harmony, but by making any change in a system
so well compacted. The administration was firm,
in good harmony with one another, and headed by the
most successful genius that ever presided over our
councils. Conquest had crowned our arms with wonderful
circumstances of glory and fortune; and the
young King seemed to have the option of extending
our victories and acquisitions, or of giving peace to
the world, by finding himself in a situation so favourable,
that neither his ambition nor moderation could
have been equitably reprehended. The designs and
offences of France would have justified a fuller measure
of revenge; moderation could want no excuse.</p>

<p>A passionate, domineering woman, and a Favourite,
without talents, soon drew a cloud over this shining
prospect.</p>

<p>Without anticipating events too hastily, let it suffice
to say, that the measure of war was pushed, without
even a desire that it should be successful; and
that, although successful, it was unnaturally checked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
by a peace, too precipitate, too indigested, and too
shameful, to merit the coldest eulogy of moderation.</p>

<p>The first moment of the new reign afforded a
symptom of the Prince’s character; of that cool dissimulation
in which he had been so well initiated by
his mother, and which comprehended almost the
whole of what she had taught him. Princess Amalie,
as soon as she was certain of her father’s death, sent
an account of it to the Prince of Wales; but he had
already been apprised of it. He was riding, and
received a note from a German valet-de-chambre,
attendant on the late King, with a private mark
agreed upon between them, which certified him of the
event. Without surprise or emotion, without dropping
a word that indicated what had happened, he said
his horse was lame, and turned back to Kew. At
dismounting he said to the groom, “I have said this
horse is lame; I forbid you to say the contrary.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt was the first who arrived at Kensington,
and went to Princess Amalie for her orders. She told
him nobody could give him better counsel than his
own. He asked if he ought not to go to the Prince?
she replied, she could not advise him; but thought it
would be right. He went. I mention these little
circumstances, because they show from Mr. Pitt’s
uncertainty, that he was possessed with none of the
confidence and ardour of a man who thinks himself a
favourite.</p>

<p>From Kew the new King went directly to Carleton
House, which belonged to the Princess Dowager;
ordering his servants and the Privy Council to wait for
him at Saville House, then his own residence; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
adjoining to Leicester House, where the Princess
usually lived. The Duke of Cumberland went to
Leicester House, and waited two hours; but was sent
for, as soon as the King knew it, to Carleton House,
where he determined to stay, and avoid the parade
and acclamation of passing through the streets: at the
same time dismissing the guards, and ordering them
to attend the body of his grandfather.</p>

<p>To the Duke of Cumberland he marked great kindness,
and told him it had not been common in their
family to live well together; but he was determined
to live well with all his family. And he carried this
attention so far, as to take notice to the Duke after
council, that his friend Mr. Fox looked in great
health. And again, when the Privy Council had made
their address to his Majesty by the mouth of the
Archbishop, it not being thought decent that the compliment
on the death of his father should be uttered
by the Duke, the King remarked it, and expressed
an apprehension that they had put a slight upon his
uncle. Nor would he suffer the name of his brother,
the Duke of York, to be mentioned in the public
prayers, because it must have taken place of that of
the Duke of Cumberland.</p>

<p>At that first council the King spoke to nobody in
particular but his former governor, Lord Waldegrave.
His speech to them he made with dignity and propriety.
In whatever related to his predecessor, he
behaved with singular attention and decency, refusing
at first to give the word to the guard; and then only
renewing what the late King had given. He sent to
Princess Amalie to know where her father’s will was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
deposited. She said, one copy had been entrusted to
her eight or nine years before; but thinking the King
had forgotten it, she had lately put him in mind of it.
He had replied, “Did not she know, that when a new
will was made, it cancelled all preceding?” No
curiosity, no eagerness, no haste was expressed by the
new King on that head; nor the smallest impediment
thrown in the way of his grandfather’s intentions. A
Gentleman<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> of the Bedchamber was immediately dismissed,
who refused to sit up with the body, as is usual.
Wilmot<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and Ranby,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> the late King’s physician and
surgeon, acquainted the King with two requests of
their master, which were punctually complied with.
They were, that his body might be embalmed as soon
as possible, and a double quantity of perfumes used;
and that the side of the late Queen’s coffin, left loose
on purpose, might be taken away, and his body laid
close to hers.</p>

<p>In his first council the King named his brother the
Duke of York, and Lord Bute,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> of the Cabinet. As no
notice was taken of Lord Huntingdon, it indicated an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
uncertainty, whether he, who had been Master of the
Horse to the King when Prince, or Lord Gower, who
had held that office under the late King, should fill the
post. To the Speaker of the House of Commons the
King said, it should not be his fault if that assembly
did not go upon business earlier in the day than they
had done of late: a flattering speech to an old man
attached to old forms.</p>

<p>The King’s speech to his council afforded matter of
remark, and gave early specimen of who was to be the
confidential minister, and what measures were to be
pursued: for it was drawn by Lord Bute, and communicated
to none of the King’s servants. It talked <em>of a
bloody and expensive war, and of obtaining an honourable
and lasting peace</em>. Thus was it delivered; but Mr.
Pitt went to Lord Bute that evening, and after an
altercation of three hours, prevailed that in the printed
copy the words should be changed to <em>an expensive but
just and necessary war</em>; and that after the words <em>honourable
peace</em> should be inserted, <em>in concert with our allies</em>.
Lord Mansfield and others counselled these palliatives
too; but it was two o’clock of the following afternoon
before the King would yield to the alteration. Whether,
that the private Junto could not digest the correction,
or whether to give an idea of his Majesty’s
firmness, I know not: but great pains were taken to
imprint an idea of the latter, as characteristic of the
new reign; and it was sedulously whispered by the
creatures of the Favourite and the mother, that it was
the plan to retain all the late King’s ministers, but
that his Majesty would not be governed by them, as
his grandfather had been. In confirmation of part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
this advertisement, the King told the Duke of Newcastle
and Mr. Pitt, that he knew their attachment to
the Crown, and should expect theirs, and the assistance
of all honest men.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt was too quicksighted not to perceive what
would be the complexion of the new reign. His favourite
war was already struck at. He himself had
for some time been on the coldest terms with Lord
Bute; for possession of power, and reversion of power,
could not fail to make two natures so haughty, incompatible.
It was said, and I believe with truth, that an
outset so unpromising to his darling measures, made
Mr. Pitt propose to the Duke of Newcastle a firm
union against the Favourite; but the Duke loved intrigues
and new allies too well to embrace it. And
from that refusal has been dated Mr. Pitt’s animosity
to Newcastle; though the part the latter took more
openly and more hostilely against him afterwards was
sufficient cause for that resentment. Whether these
two men, so powerful in parliament and in the nation,
could have balanced the headlong affection that attends
every new young Prince, is uncertain,—I think
they could. A war so triumphant had captivated the
whole country. The Favourite was unknown, ungracious,
and a Scot: his connexion with the Princess, an
object of scandal. He had no declared party; and
what he had, was insignificant. Nor would he probably
have dared to stem such a body of force as
would have appeared against him. At least the union
of Pitt and Newcastle would have checked the torrent,
which soon carried everything in favour of Prerogative.
Newcastle’s time-serving undermined Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Pitt, was destructive to himself, threw away all the
advantages of the war, and brought the country to
the brink of ruin.</p>

<p>Yet this veteran, so busy, so selfish, and still so fond
of power, for a few days acted the part he ought to
have adopted in earnest. He waited on the King,
pleaded his age, and begged to be excused from entering
on a new reign. The King told him he could not
part with him. Fortified with this gracious and comfortable
command, he next consulted his friends. It
was not their interest to point out to him the ridicule
of thinking to rule in the Cabinet of a third George,
almost a boy. Four days more determined the Duke
to take a new court-lease of folly.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Devonshire,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> though greatly younger,
might not have been without difficulties too, if he had
pleased to remember them. He had been ill-treated
in the late reign by the Prince and the Princess Dowager,
hated the Favourite, and had declared he would
quit, whenever the new reign should commence; but
he thought better of it.</p>

<p>The Princess, whose ambition yielded to none, was
desirous to figure in the new era, and demanded to be
declared <i>Princess-Mother</i>. Precedents were searched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
for in vain; and she missed even this shadow of compensation
for the loss of the appellation of <i>Queen</i>—a
loss which she showed a little afterwards she could not
digest.</p>

<p>The Earl of Bute seemed to act with more moderation.
His credit was manifest; but he allotted himself
no ministerial office, contenting himself for the
present with the post of Groom of the Stole, which he
had filled under the Prince, and for which room was
prepared, by removing the Earl of Rochford<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> with a
large pension. Lord Bute’s agents gave out, that he
would upon no account interfere or break with Mr.
Pitt. The latter, however, did not trust to these
vague assurances, but endeavoured to maintain the
preceding system: talked to the King of the Duke
of Newcastle as first minister, and as wishing him to
continue so; and said he had never chosen any other
channel for his addresses or demands to the late King—an
intimation that he would make none through
Lord Bute. For himself, he had meddled with nothing
but the war, and he wished his Majesty to give
some mark that he approved the measures of the late
reign.</p>

<p>The other ministers were not less attentive to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
own views. The Duke of Bedford<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> insisted on returning
to the Government of Ireland, and that Lord
Gower<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> should remain Master of the Horse; but the
latter point was accommodated by the removal of Sir
Thomas Robinson (with a pension) from the Great
Wardrobe, which was bestowed on Lord Gower; and
Lord Huntingdon continued in the post he had enjoyed
under the Prince. Mr. Mackenzie, the Favourite’s
brother, was destined to be Master of the Robes,
but was forced to give way to the Duke of Newcastle,
who obtained it for Mr. Brudenel;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> for though bent
on making his court, his Grace as often marred his
own policy as promoted it.</p>

<p>Yet this seeming union of Pitt and Newcastle, on
which the influence of the former in some measure
depended, disgusted the City. They said, that Mr.
Pitt had temporized with Newcastle before from
necessity, but now it was matter of election. Yet
by the intervention of Mr. Pitt’s agents, the City of
London recommended to the King to be advised by
his grandfather’s ministers; and they even hinted at
the loss the King of Prussia would suffer by the death
of his uncle. Their attachment to their idol did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
stop there. The first stone of the new bridge at
Blackfriars was laid by the Lord Mayor a few days
after the King’s accession, and on it was engraved
so bombast an inscription in honour of Mr. Pitt, and
drawn up in such bad Latin, that it furnished ample
matter of ridicule to his enemies.</p>

<p>The Favourite, though traversed in his views by
the power of these two predominant men, had not
patience to be wholly a cypher, but gave many lesser
and indirect marks of his designs. A separate standard
was to be erected. Lord George Sackville had leave
to pay his duty to the King, and was well received;
which gave such offence to Mr. Pitt, that Lord George
was privately instructed to discontinue his attendance.
Lady Mary Stuart,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> daughter of the Favourite, and
Lady Susan Stuart,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> daughter of the Earl of Galloway,
a notorious and intemperate Jacobite, were named
of the Bedchamber to the Lady Augusta, the King’s
eldest sister; and Sir Henry Erskine<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> was restored
to his rank, and gratified with an old regiment. The
Earl of Litchfield, Sir Walter Bagot, and the principal
Jacobites, went to Court, which George Selwyn, a
celebrated wit, accounted for, from the number of
Stuarts that were now at St. James’s.</p>

<p>The countenance shown to the Tories, and to their
citadel, the University of Oxford, was at first supposed
by those who stood at distance from the penetralia, the
measure of Mr. Pitt, as consonant to his known desire
of uniting, that was, breaking all parties. But the
Tories, who were qualified for nothing above a secret,
could not keep even that. They came to Court, it is
true; but they came with all their old prejudices.
They abjured their ancient master, but retained their
principles; and seemed to have exchanged nothing
but their badge, <i>the White Rose</i> for <i>the White Horse</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
<em>Prerogative</em> became a fashionable word; and the language
of the times was altered, before the Favourite
dared to make any variation in the Ministry.</p>

<p>These steps did not pass unnoticed: nor was the
nation without jealousy, even in the first dawn of the
reign. Papers were stuck up at the Royal Exchange
and in Westminster-hall, with these words, <em>no Petticoat
Government, no Scotch Favourite</em>. An intemperance
which proceeded so far afterwards, that, as the
King passed in his chair to visit his mother in an
evening, the mob asked him if he was going to suck?
The Princess herself was obliged to discontinue frequenting
the theatres, so gross and insulting were the
apostrophes with which she was saluted from the
galleries.</p>

<p>The views of the Court were so fully manifested
afterwards, that no doubt can be entertained but a plan
had been early formed of carrying the prerogative to
very unusual heights. The Princess was ardently fond
of power, and all its appanages of observance, rank and
wealth. The deepest secrecy and dissimulation
guarded every avenue of her passions; and close retirement
was adapted to these purposes. She could not
appear in public (after the arrival of the Queen) as the
first woman of the kingdom: her unpopularity made
her pride tremble; and privacy shrouded such hours as
were not calculated to draw esteem; and it contracted
her expenses. After the King’s marriage she appeared
seldom or never at St. James’s, nor deigned to accompany
the ceremony of the coronation. The attendance
of her ladies was dispensed with except on drawing-room
days; and by degrees even her maids of honour and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
women of the bedchamber were removed from her
palace, where she lived in a solitude that would have
passed for the perfection of Christian humility in the
ages of monkish ignorance. Jealousy of her credit
over her son made her impose almost as strict laws of
retirement on him. He was accessible to none of his
Court but at the stated hours of business and ceremony:
nor was any man but the Favourite, and the
creatures with whom he had garrisoned the palace,
allowed to converse with the King. Affection had no
share in this management.</p>

<p>The Princess, who was never supposed to disclose
her mind with freedom,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> but on the single topic of her
own children, had often mentioned her eldest son with
contempt; and during the life of her husband, had
given in to all his partiality for the Duke of York.
When her views of governing by her husband were
cut off, she applied to the untutored inexperience of
his heir: and the first step towards the influence she
meditated, was by filling his mind with suspicions and
ill impressions of all mankind. His uncle, the Duke
of Cumberland, was made another instrument. The
young Prince had a great appetite: he was asked if he
wished to be as gross as his uncle? Every vice, every
condescension was imputed to the Duke, that the
Prince might be stimulated to avoid them.</p>

<p>The Favourite, who had notions of honour, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
ostentatious, endeavoured to give a loftier cast to the
disposition of his pupil, though not to the disparagement
of the vassalage in which he was to be kept. Lord
Bute had a little reading,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and affected learning. Men
of genius, the arts and artists were to be countenanced.
The arts might amuse the young King’s solitary hours:
authors might defend the measures of government,
and were sure to pay for their pensions with incense,
both to their passive and active protectors. The
pedantry and artifice of these shallow views served
but to produce ridicule. Augustus fell asleep over
drawings and medals, which were pushed before him
every evening; and Mæcenas had so little knowledge,
and so little taste, that his own letters grew a proverb
for want of orthography; and the scribblers he countenanced,
were too destitute of talents to raise his
character or their own. The coins of the King were
the worst that had appeared for above a century; and
the revenues of the Crown were so soon squandered in
purchasing dependents, that architecture, the darling
art of Lord Bute, was contracted from the erection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
a new palace, to altering a single door-case in the
drawing-room at St. James’s. Yet, his emissaries the
Scotch were indefatigable in coining popular sayings
and sentences for the King. It was given out that
he would suffer no money to be spent on elections.
Circumstances that recoiled with force, when every
one of those aphorisms were contradicted by practice.</p>

<p>But the chief engine to conciliate favour was the
King’s piety. The Princess, no doubt, intended it
should be real, for she lived in dread of a mistress.
But mankind was not inclined to think that her
morals could have imprinted much devotion on the
mind of her son: nor was any man the dupe of those
professions but Secker, the Archbishop, who for the
first days of the reign flattered himself with the idea
of becoming first minister in a Court that hoisted the
standard of religion. He was unwearied in attendance
at St. James’s,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and in presenting bodies of clergy;
and his assiduity was so bustling and assuming, that
having pushed aside the Duke of Cumberland to get
at the King, his Royal Highness reprimanded him with
a bitter taunt. The prelate soon discovered his mistake.
Nor were the Princess or the Favourite inclined
to trust the King in the hands of a Churchman, whom
they knew so well, and whose sanctity was as equivocal
as their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
As far as could be discerned of the King’s natural
disposition, it was humane and benevolent. If flowing
courtesy to all men was the habit of his dissimulation,
at least, it was so suited to his temper, that no gust of
passion, no words of bitterness were ever known to
break from him. He accepted services with grace
and appearance of feeling: and if he forgot them
with an unrestrained facility, yet he never marked his
displeasure with harshness. Silence served him to
bear with unwelcome ministers, or to part with them.
His childhood was tinctured with obstinacy: it was
adopted at the beginning of his reign, and called
firmness; but did not prove to be his complexion. In
truth, it would be difficult to draw his character in
positive colours. He had neither passions nor activity.
He resigned himself obsequiously to the government
of his mother and Lord Bute: learned, and even
entered with art into the lessons they inspired, but
added nothing of his own. When the task was done,
he relapsed into indifference and indolence, till roused
to the next day’s part.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>The first gust of faction that threatened the new
era, was an intended duel between the Earl of Albemarle<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
and General George Townshend.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> A pamphlet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
was published against the latter,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> reflecting bitterly on
the vanity with which he had assumed a principal share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
in the conquest of Quebec, though the honour of signing
the capitulation had only fallen to him by the
death of Wolfe and the wounds of Monckton; an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
honour so little merited, that he had done his utmost
to traverse Wolfe’s plans. The pamphlet, too, set forth
the justice of taking such freedom with a man whose
ill-nature had seized every opportunity of ridiculing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
those he disliked by exhibiting their personal defects
in caricatures, which he had been the first to apply to
politics. His uncle the Duke of Newcastle, the Duke
of Cumberland, and Mr. Fox, had been the chief
objects of those buffoon satires. The pamphlet was
certainly written under the direction of the last, and
could not fail to be agreeable to the partizans of the
second. It wounded so deeply, that Townshend, in
the first blindness of his rage, concluded it came from
the person he hated most and had most offended: that
was the Duke of Cumberland: and as Lord Albemarle
was the first favourite of his Royal Highness, thither
Townshend addressed his resentment, though no man
was less an author than the Earl. A challenge passed,
was accepted, and prevented in time by Townshend’s
want of caution.</p>

<p>On the 18th of November the Parliament met.
Many Tories, though they had received no formal
invitation, appeared at the Cockpit to hear the King’s
speech read. It was composed, as usual, by Lord
Hardwicke, was long and dull, and had received additions
from Pitt. On the Address Beckford proposed
to push the war with more vigour, the end of the last
campaign having, he said, been languid. Pitt fired
at this reproach from his friend, though certainly not
levelled at him, and asked Beckford what new species
of extravagance he wished for? The Address from
Oxford had other objects in view. They boasted openly
of their attachment to Monarchy. As all places were
already filled with Whigs, the Court was forced to
increase the establishment, in order to admit their
devotees. The King’s Bedchamber received six or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
eight additional Grooms and seven Gentlemen. Most
of the late King’s were continued; the King’s own
were joined with them; the rest were taken from the
Tories.</p>

<p>The Duke of Richmond,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> haughty and young, was
offended that his cousin, Colonel Keppel,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> was removed
from Gentleman of the Horse, which the King
destined for one of his own servants. The Duke
asked an audience; but began it with objecting to
the distinction paid to Sir Henry Erskine.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> This so
much disgusted, that the King would not hear the
Duke on the subject of Keppel. On cooler thoughts,
Lord Bute was sent to the Duke, to offer him to be of
the King’s Bedchamber. He accepted it, on condition
that Keppel should remain Gentleman of the Horse,
which was likewise granted. But this pacification
lasted few days. Lord Fitzmaurice,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> a favourite of
Lord Bute, was made Equerry to the King; though
inferior in military rank to Lord George Lenox<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Charles Fitzroy,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> brothers of the Dukes of Richmond
and Grafton. The latter<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> had been of the Bedchamber
to the King, when Prince, but had quitted it,
from dislike of Court attendance, and disgusted with
the haughty stateliness affected by Lord Bute. Richmond
and Grafton were much of an age; each regarded
himself as Prince of the Blood; and emulation
soon created a sort of rivalship between them. The
Duke of Richmond’s figure was noble, and his countenance
singularly handsome. The Duke of Grafton
was low, but manly, and with much grace in his
address. The passions of both were strong, but of
the first, ardent; of the latter, slow and inflexible.
His temper was not happy; but the Duke of Richmond’s,
which was thought worse, because more impetuous,
was pliant, and uncommonly easy and accommodating
in his family and society. Both were thought
avaricious; but the latter very unjustly, generally approaching
nearer to the opposite extreme of profusion.
His parts, too, were quicker and more subtle than
Grafton’s and more capable of application, though his
elocution was much inferior. The Duke of Grafton
had a grace and dignity in his utterance that commanded
attention, and dazzled in lieu of matter; and
his temper being shy and reserved, he was supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
to be endued with more steadiness than his subsequent
conduct displayed. Neither of them wanted
obstinacy; but their obstinacy not flowing from system,
it was in both a torrent more impetuous in its
course than in its duration.</p>

<p>The Duke of Grafton made a decent representation
to the King, on the wrong done to his brother, and
demanded rank for him. The other Duke carried a
violent memorial, and commented on it in a manner,
which some years afterwards he found had never been
forgotten or forgiven. The next day he resigned the
Bedchamber, but not his regiment. In a few days he
repented this step, and went to Lord Bute to explain
away his resignation, which, he said, might not be
known. Lord Bute replied, all the world knew it.
The Duke, thinking this coldness proceeded from a
suspicion that he was influenced by Fox,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> his brother-in-law,
disclaimed all connexion with him, and said,
he had never approved his sister’s marriage. Lord
Bute, who even then probably had views of Fox’s
support, as a counterbalance to Pitt, replied, that Mr.
Fox’s alliance could be a disgrace to no man; as he
must always be of great use and weight in this country.
Yet the Duke’s youth and frankness made him
avow what he had said to Fox himself, in the presence
of Lord Albemarle, who, though not much older, had
far more worldly cunning, and no doubt reported the
conversation to his master, the Duke of Cumberland;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
for Richmond and Albemarle, though first cousins,
were no friends; and the latter possessed all the arts
of a Court. The Duke, rebuffed by the Favourite,
next consulted the Duke of Cumberland, who told
him prudently, that he was sorry the Duke of Richmond,
at twenty-three, had quarrelled with the King,
at twenty-two; and advised him to retire into the
country, which he did. The effects of these squabbles
will appear hereafter, which made it proper to state
them here.</p>

<p>The King’s revenue was settled and fixed to eight
hundred thousand pounds a year, certain. In the late
reign any overplus was to accrue to the Crown, but
had ever produced so trifling an augmentation, that
the present boasted restriction, which was often quoted
as one great merit of the new Government, was not
worth mentioning. It is true, this revenue was by no
means ample, considering the large incumbrances with
which it was loaded. The Duke of Cumberland’s annuity
(exclusive of the parliamentary grant of twenty-five
thousand pounds a year) was fifteen thousand
pounds; Princess Amalie’s, twelve thousand. The
King’s brothers were to be provided for out of it;
so was a future Queen; and the Princess Dowager’s
jointure was of fifty thousand pounds a year from the
same fund. Yet, though her dower was so great—though
she reduced her family, and lived in a privacy
that exceeded economy, and though she had a third of
the Dutchy of Cornwall, which produced four thousand
pounds a year more, her passion for money was
so great, that she obtained an additional annuity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
ten thousand pounds a year from her son.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The Electorate
suffered for these exigences of the Crown.
Whatever money could be drawn from thence was
sunk in the privy purse, which was entirely under the
direction of Lord Bute.</p>

<p>The Earl of Litchfield,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> a leader of the Tories, was
added to the King’s Bedchamber, as the Earl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Oxford<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and Lord Bruce<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> had been before, with
the Scotch Earls of March<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and Eglinton.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> The
Lord Viscount Middleton,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> an Irish Peer, was the
first who in the House of Commons here broached
a hint of jealousy against the channel in which Court
favour seemed to flow. He was ridiculed for it by
Charles Townshend; but the spirit of dissatisfaction
had been infused into the former by the Duke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Newcastle, who openly censured the new partiality
to the Tories. Partiality there was, but the grievance
came with an ill grace from Newcastle, Stone,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
suspected for more than a Tory, had been placed
by him as preceptor to the King; Lord Mansfield
had been his bosom favourite; and to gratify that
favourite, the extension of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Habeas Corpus</i> had
been prevented. To gain the Tories had been a
prudent measure, but their principles were still more
welcome to the Court than their votes. Having only
votes to offer, and neither numbers nor abilities, they
brought much discredit on their patron, and little
strength to his assistance.</p>

<p>In Ireland the prospect was not more promising.
By Poyning’s law the Privy Council of Ireland are
to transmit hither all heads of bills, particularly of
money-bills. This latter was omitted by the intrigues
of the Primate, courting popularity. The bills were
sent back, with a severe reprimand for the omission
of a money-bill. Mr. Pitt alone took up the defence
of the Irish Commons, and would not sign the message,
which thirty-four others of the English Privy Council
who were present signed. The King thanked the
Duke of Bedford for supporting his prerogative, but
the Privy Council of Ireland wrote angry letters to
the Duke and his minister Rigby, telling them that
they must not come into that Kingdom again. The
Duke, a little before, had been challenged even in
print by a mad Lord Clanrickard,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> whose letter being
complained of by his Grace, the Council here ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
the Attorney-General to prosecute the Earl: Rigby,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
too, sent him a challenge, which he did not accept.
The Lords Justices sent over a strong remonstrance
in vindication of their conduct, and there the matter
ended for the present; but in the beginning of the
next year the Lords Justices renewed the attack on
their Governor, and he and Rigby were burned in
effigy. Mr. Pitt interposed, and prevailed to have
a temperate memorial sent to the Justices, arguing
the point with them, and to <em>that</em> he offered <em>to set his
little name</em>, which was done. The Lords Justices
submitted, but with threats from the Primate of
resigning his part of the government. Nor yet did
they send a new bill, but a plan for raising the money
already voted. Lord Clanrickard, in answer to Rigby’s
challenge, which had been printed and dispersed in
Ireland, replied in print likewise, excusing his not
appearing at Holyhead, the appointed rendezvous,
on account of the prosecution directed against him,
though the prosecution in date was subsequent to
the challenge by two months. The Earl affirmed
that he had proposed to Mr. Rigby a new place of
meeting; but a year or two afterwards, on an accidental
journey of Rigby to Ireland, the Earl seemed
very glad that an interposition was made, and the
quarrel accommodated. The ill-humour of the country,
however, determined the Duke of Bedford to quit
the Government, after having amply gratified his
family and dependents with pensions. The Earl of
Kildare, for taking no part in these divisions, was
rewarded with a marquisate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Foreign affairs fluctuated with their old vicissitude.
The Russians and Austrians made themselves masters
of Berlin, and treated it with more lenity than could
be expected from such barbarians and incensed enemies.
But they relinquished it in a few days; and
before the close of the year the King’s fortune and
arms recovered their lustre by a signal victory, which
he gained in person near Torgau, over his great competitor
in glory, Marshal Daun, who was wounded in
the thigh, and carried from the field; a circumstance
that did not impeach his fame, as the loss of the day
was attributed to his absence.</p>

<p>Yet this victory, shining as it was, could not counterbalance
the new spirit that was gone forth in England
to the disparagement of the war. Lord Hardwicke
had long distasted it; and under his countenance
had been published a Tract, setting forth the
burthen and ill-policy of our German measures. It
was called <cite>Considerations on the German War</cite>; was
shrewdly and ably written, and had more operation in
working a change on the minds of men, than perhaps
ever fell to the lot of a pamphlet.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> The author was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
one Mauduit, formerly a Dissenting teacher, and at
that time a factor at Blackwell-hall. How agreeable
his politics were to the interior of the Court, soon
appeared by a place being bestowed on him by Lord
Bute. Still, however, the Favourite left the contest
to be managed by other hands; and he had acted
wisely to have adhered to that plan. A new and
formidable expedition had been preparing. Newcastle
and Hardwicke had quitted the Council, because they
could not prevail to have it laid aside. Yet it was
postponed for some time. Pitt, in the House of Commons,
taking notice of the pacific spirit that he saw
arising, said, “Some are for keeping Canada; some,
Guadaloupe; who will tell me which I shall be hanged
for not keeping?”</p>

<p>On opening the ways and means for the ensuing
year, George Grenville opposed the intended tax on
ale and beer; the first overt act of his disagreement
with Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>The new year opened with promotions. The Lord
Keeper Henley was made Lord Chancellor. Lord
Denbigh,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> a creature of the Favourite, Master of the
Harriers; and George Grenville<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> was called to the
Cabinet Council. Pitt had ever treated him with contempt,
and little expected to find him vain or daring
enough to enter the lists against him. Grenville’s
conceit of himself was by no means measured by the
standard of modesty. His ambition was equal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Pitt’s; and his plodding, methodic genius made him
take the spirit of detail for ability. Avarice, which
he possessed in no less proportion than his other passions,
concurred to lead him from a master, who browbeat
and treated him superciliously, to worship the
rising sun. Lord Bute was in want of tools; and it
was a double prize to acquire them from his rival’s
shop.</p>

<p>But Fortune, had he known how to use her gifts,
was kinder to the Favourite than his own politics. His
wife’s father, old Wortley Montagu, died at this time,
and left to her and her second son a fortune, that, at
four per cent., was estimated at one million three
hundred and forty thousand pounds. This was the
third death within twelve months that happened to
aggrandize Lord Bute. The decease of his uncle, the
Duke of Argyle,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> left Scotland open to his power;
and that of the late King put the Crown itself into
his hands. The estate of his father-in-law was all he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
was qualified to enjoy. What could be expected from
a boy<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> locked up from the converse of mankind,
governed by a mother still more retired, who was
under the influence of a man that had passed his life
in solitude, and was too haughty to admit to his familiarity
but half a dozen silly authors and flatterers?
Sir Henry Erskine,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> a military poet, Home,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> a tragedy-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>writing
parson, and Worseley,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> a rider of the great
horse and architect, were his principal confidents. The
nation was soon governed accordingly. And yet it
was not the nation’s fault, if it did not receive the
yoke even from this Junto!</p>

<p>No trouble was given to the Government by the
old Parliament, which still subsisted, and continued to
lend all facilities to the progress of the war. An estimate
of three hundred thousand pounds due to the
Chancery of Hanover, for forage for the use of Hanoverians,
Prussians, and Hessians, was voted to be paid,
without a division, though not without some comments.
Sir Francis Dashwood, Cooke,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Coventry,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and
Beckford<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> opposed it. Coventry said with a sneer,
he was glad so <em>just</em> a debt was demanded before the
nation was bankrupt, and unable to discharge it.
Beckford imputed the extravagance of the war (which
indeed was notorious) to the Duke of Newcastle, who,
he supposed, intended to overturn Mr. Pitt’s system,
and prevent the continuation of the war, by the excess
of the expense; and he commended the management
of the Treasury during the short time in which it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
been in the Duke of Devonshire’s hands. Legge<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
defended the measure, and both Newcastle’s and Devonshire’s
administrations. Pitt was confined with the
gout, and not present.</p>

<p>In the last treaty with the Landgrave of Hesse, had
been stipulated a secret article of indemnification to
that country. Many sums had been allowed to them,
to avoid the appearance in public of the article itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Mr. Pitt had at once granted them sixty thousand
pounds on that score. Yet now at last was Administration
forced to lay before Parliament a demand of
four hundred thousand pounds for indemnification to
the Landgravate. Legge, who knew himself fallen
into disgrace with Lord Bute, refused to make the
motion, on which he received intimation that he must
resign. Lord Winchelsea<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> said, Legge had had more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
masters than any man in England, and had never left
one with a character. Lord Barrington,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> therefore,
made the demand. Beckford again declaimed on the
extravagance of the war. Sir Francis Dashwood said,
he had always disapproved the continental war, but
would agree to vote the money, (which was a sum of
two hundred and sixty thousand pounds for three
years,) as we were bound by treaty to pay it; and he
found fault with more authorities not being laid before
Parliament. This money too was granted on March 6.</p>

<p>Three days before, the King had gone to Parliament,
to desire that the places of the judges, which
were held during the life of the Prince on the Throne,
might be fixed to them for their own lives. This was
one of Lord Bute’s strokes of pedantry. The tenure
of the judges had formerly been a popular topic; and
had been secured as far as was necessary. He thought
this trifling addition would be popular now, when
nobody thought or cared about it. When, not long
afterwards, the advocates for the Court were puzzled
to produce instances of favour to the constitution or
to the cause of liberty, this boon to the judges was
sounded high, and repeated in every panegyric.</p>

<p>Nothing more of note occurred in this session. All
attention was engrossed by the approaching general election
of a new Parliament. It had been propagated that
the King had forbidden any money to be issued from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the Treasury. Nothing was less true in fact, or proved
less true in effect. Both the Court and particulars
went greater lengths than in any preceding times. In
truth, the corruption of electors met, if not exceeded,
that of candidates. The borough of Sudbury was so
shameless, as to advertise itself to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>But, preparatory to a new Parliament, and as an
intimation to men under whom they should list, the
Favourite determined to appear more ostensibly in the
character of Minister. Accordingly, on the 12th of
March, orders were suddenly sent to Lord Holderness
to give up the seals of Secretary of State: the King
adding, in discourse, that he had two secretaries, one
(Mr. Pitt) who would do nothing, and the other (Lord
Holderness) who could do nothing;<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> he would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
one, who both could and would. This was Lord Bute,
to whom the Seals were immediately delivered. Subduing
Europe was reckoned nothing, as the service
was ungracious: and however low the talents of Lord
Holderness deserved to be estimated, they did not
suffer by comparison with those of his successor. Mr.
Pitt resented the fall of his creature, but was sweetened
by the offer of cofferer to James Grenville.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>
Newcastle rejoiced, having been deserted by Holderness;
but affected to be concerned: yet was not struck
with the warning that this measure ought to have
been to himself. Mr. Pitt felt it more sensibly, and
would not part with Lord Temple, who might have
been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, but was necessary
to him in the House of Lords, where his measures had
no other champion. Lord Halifax was named to that
great office; the Duke of Bedford refused to accept
any post; but it was supposed had his eye on the
Seals, which everybody expected disgust would soon
oblige Mr. Pitt to resign.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more injudicious than this step
taken by the Favourite. The conduct he ought to
have pursued was obvious; which was, lying quiet, till
some or all of a few events, most probable to happen,
should have paved the way to his taking the reins.
Newcastle was old, Mr. Pitt very infirm. Their
deaths, or at least a rupture between them, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
have delivered him from them; at least have constituted
him umpire between them. Any sinister event
of the war might have demolished Mr. Pitt’s popularity.
Prudence, at least, should have dictated to
Lord Bute to await the conclusion of the peace, which,
however good, would have given a shock to Mr. Pitt’s
credit, from the impossibility of contenting all mankind.
But the Favourite was as impatient to have the
honour of making that peace, as if he had intended to
make it an honourable one. His thrusting himself
into administration at the moment he did, was so
preposterous, that most men thought him betrayed
into it by malicious advice. The Duke of Bedford,
to pay his court, and from desire of peace, certainly
counselled it; but Newcastle, and Hardwicke too,
were generally believed to have infused the same
advice, with a view to his destruction; for while only
Groom of the Stole, Lord Bute stood in no responsible
place. This was the more likely, as what emoluments
they obtained for their friends in the new shuffling of
the cards, by no means compensated for the credit they
lost by the appearance of this new star in the horizon
of power.</p>

<p>The Duke of Rutland<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> was named Groom of the
Stole; Lord Sandys,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> First Lord of Trade, but upon
the ancient footing; the West Indies, to please Mr.
Pitt, being again put under the province of the Secretary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of State. The Duke of Leeds<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> was turned back
to his old place of Justice in Eyre, in the room of Lord
Sandys, but with an additional salary of a thousand
pounds a year. Legge, who refused to resign, was dismissed;
and Lord Barrington made Chancellor of the
Exchequer; being succeeded by Charles Townshend<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> as
Secretary at War. Sir Francis Dashwood was made
Treasurer of the Chambers. Elliot,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> another of Lord
Bute’s court, succeeded James Grenville at the Board
of Treasury. Lord Villiers<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> and Thomas Pelham<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
were placed in the Admiralty, as John Yorke, Lord
Hardwicke’s fourth son, Rice,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> son-in-law of Lord
Talbot, and Sir Edmund Thomas were at the Board of
Trade. Mr. Spencer<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> and Sir Richard Grosvenor (at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
the recommendation of Mr. Pitt) were created Viscounts;
Sir Thomas Robinson,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Sir Nathaniel Curzon,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
a rich Tory, Sir William Irby,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> chamberlain to the
Princess, were made barons, along with Dodington,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
whose ambition still hovered about the Court, in
which he was at last likely to have some lead, by his
connexion with the Favourite. Nor did Lord Bath<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
himself quit sight of the back-stairs, by which he
obtained leave to hobble up to the King whenever he
pleased.</p>

<p>But a phenomenon, that for some time occasioned
more speculation than even the credit of the Favourite,
was the staff of Lord Steward being put into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
hands of Lord Talbot,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> with the addition of an earldom.
As neither gravity, rank, interest, abilities, nor
morals could be adduced to countenance this strange
exaltation, no wonder it caused very unfavourable
comments. This Lord had long affected a very free-spoken
kind of patriotism on all occasions. He had
some wit, and a little tincture of a disordered understanding;
but was better known as a boxer and man
of pleasure, than in the light of a statesman. The
Duchess of——had been publicly divorced from
her lord on his account; and was not the only woman
of fashion who had lived with him openly as his mistress.
He was strong, well made, and very comely;
but with no air, nor with the manners of a man of
quality. No wonder the promotion of such a minister,
in a reign that advertised piety, strengthened
the suspicions already entertained of the sincerity of
the Court. It grew more comic still, when the new
statesman appeared to be a reformer too. As the
Court knew that the measures it had in contemplation
could only be carried by money, every stratagem was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
invented to curtail the common expenses of the
Palace. As these fell under the province of the Lord
Steward, nothing was heard of but cooks cashiered,
and kitchens shut up. Even the Maids of Honour,
who did not expect rigours from a great officer of
Lord Talbot’s complexion, were reduced to complain
of the abridgement of their allowance for breakfast.
The public joined in the cry, and the shops teemed
with scandalous prints against the reformer and his
patroness.</p>

<p>The Duke of Rutland was not pleased with the
office of Groom of the Stole, which had fewer employments
in its disposal, and which was therefore given
to Lord Holderness; but the very next day the Duke
was appointed Master of the Horse, from whence Lord
Huntingdon<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> was removed to be Groom of the Stole;
and Lord Holderness was laid aside with a large
pension, and the reversion of the Cinque Ports after
the Duke of Dorset. Lady Bute was created a baroness,
that her son might inherit an English peerage.</p>

<p>When Legge resigned his Seal, he lamented being
under his Majesty’s displeasure, but said his future life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
should testify his zeal. The King replied, he was glad
to hear him say so; nothing but his future life could
eradicate the ill impressions he had received of him.
His disgrace was owing to his not having seconded the
Favourite’s views in the late reign, when Lord Bute
had been desirous of bringing a Jacobite friend into
Parliament for Hampshire, of which more will be said
hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<p>General Conway<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> was sent to command in Germany
under Lord Granby. The Bedford faction opposed it,
in favour of General Waldegrave,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> who had served
there during the whole war, upon the supposition that
Lord Granby would come to England, and that Waldegrave
might succeed him, Mostyn<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> not being equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
to the charge. Conway obtained to be sent, but without
a certain promise of replacing Lord Granby,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
though the King said Conway was a man of abilities,
character, sense, and prudence, such as was greatly
wanted there. France at this time made earnest
overtures for peace.</p>

<p>The last day of the session, March 18th, was fixed
for returning the thanks of the House of Commons
to Mr. Onslow, their Speaker, who had filled the chair
with unblemished integrity during the whole long
reign of George the Second, and who had the prudence
to quit the scene before his years and growing
infirmities made him a burthen to himself and the
public.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> No man had ever supported with more
firmness the privileges of the House, nor sustained
the dignity of his office with more authority. His
knowledge of the Constitution equalled his attachment
to it. To the Crown he behaved with all the
decorum of respect, without sacrificing his freedom
of speech. Against encroachments of the House of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Peers he was an inflexible champion. His disinterested
virtue supported him through all his pretensions;
and though to conciliate popular favour
he affected an impartiality that by turns led him
to the borders of insincerity and contradiction—and
though he was so minutely attached to forms, that
it often made him troublesome in affairs of higher
moment, it will be difficult to find a subject whom
gravity will so well become, whose knowledge will be
so useful and so accurate, and whose fidelity to his
trust will prove so unshaken.</p>

<p>Sir John Philipps<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> moved the address of thanks
to him for his great services, but so wretchedly, that
the sensibility the House showed on the occasion
flowed only from their hearts, not from any impression
made on them by the eloquence of their spokesman.
Legge seconded the motion with his usual propriety
and brevity, and <em>commended retreat</em>, God knows with
what sincerity! Others threw in their word of panegyric;
and Mr. More, of Shrewsbury, an old and acute
member, proposed to erect a statue to the Speaker’s
memory, with great encomiums on the authority with
which he had formerly kept in order such men as then
filled the Treasury-bench and composed the Opposition,
naming among the former Sir Robert Walpole
and Mr. Pelham, the latter of whom, he said, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the honour of dying a Commoner. More was a Whig
of the primitive stamp, and though attached to Sir
Robert Walpole, had withstood, and by the force of
his honest abilities had defeated, the intended clemency
of that Minister to some attainted Jacobite
families with respect to their estates. He had long
abstained from Parliament, returned to it without his
former success, and now appeared there for the last
time.</p>

<p>Henry Archer<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> proposed to address the Crown to
bestow a pecuniary reward on the Speaker’s services.
Sir John Philipps replied, he knew that was intended;
as it was; an annuity of two thousand pounds a year
to him and his son. Sir George Saville approved the
reward, but desired the Commons, not the Crown,
might have the merit of bestowing it. Velters Cornwall
made one of his absurd, ill-natured speeches,
which the House was always so kind as to take for
humour, teazing the Speaker under pretence of complimenting
him; while the good old man sat overpowered
with gratitude, and weeping over the testimonies
borne to his virtue. He rose at last, and
closed his public life in the most becoming manner;
neither over-acting modesty, nor checking the tender
sensibility which he necessarily felt at quitting the
darling occupation of his life. His thanks to the
House for their patient sufferance of his errors, and for
their gracious acceptance of his endeavours to serve
them, were shortly, but cogently, expressed; and his
voice, and the tears he could not restrain, spoke still
more forcibly how much his soul was agitated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
laudable emotions. He begged to have the address
spared, as he would accept nothing for himself, though
he would not prejudice his family. He was going, he
said, into the most close and obscure retreat, where he
should want little; and he concluded with a pathetic
prayer for the perpetuity of the Constitution. Sir
John Philipps desired that what he had uttered might
be inserted in the votes. The Speaker protested he
could not remember his own words, but the House
insisted, as Cornwall and Sir George Saville did on
the address, to which the Speaker at last acquiesced,
and it was voted. He ended with saying this was the
greatest day and the greatest honours ever known, for
they could only be conferred by a free nation.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>The next day the Parliament was prorogued, then
dissolved, and a new one chosen.</p>

<p>In this month was published a pamphlet called
“Seasonable Hints from an Honest Man on the present
Crisis.” The author, and some of the doctrines it
broached—not any merit in the composition—make it
memorable. It was written by Lord Bath,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> who
having surprised the King into a promise of the Lord-Lieutenancy
of Shropshire, was opposed by the Duke
of Newcastle, who supported Lord Powis.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> The
pamphlet, therefore, warmly attacked his Grace, taxed
him with his cabals and resignation in the last rebellion,
and it defended the measure of admitting the
Tories to a participation of power. In general, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
language of the pamphlet was that of the Court, who
conducted themselves by the advice bequeathed by
Lord Bolingbroke, who had, and with truth, assured
the late Prince of Wales, that the Tories would be the
heartiest in the support of prerogative. The censure
passed on pensions was not equally flattering to the
Court, the new reign having already bestowed them
profusely. Yet much the book vaunted the King’s
declaration against corruption in elections, which had
gone no farther than to undermine the Duke of Newcastle’s
influence. The private Junto was impatient
to conclude the peace, that they might prosecute the
intended war on the old ministry at home, the established
harmony being solely produced by the war, as
had often been the case at Rome. A few pedantic
examples were the sum of Lord Bute’s knowledge;
yet his partizans affected to celebrate the care he had
taken of the King’s education. A well-founded panegyric
on a man who was deficient in the orthography
of his own language! The King had had able preceptors:
the Bishop of Norwich<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> was a scholar; the
Bishop of Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> not deficient. Stone and Scott
had taste and knowledge. Lord Waldegrave, for
forming a King, was not to be matched. It proved,
indeed, that his Majesty had learned nothing, but
what a man, who knew nothing, could teach him.</p>

<p>About the end of March, France renewed the most
pressing solicitations for peace. They frankly avowed
the distress of their affairs; for they did not apprehend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
hard-heartedness in the new Court. Augsburgh
they proposed for the place of congress, or any other
town the King should name, professing they would
treat <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis-à-vis du Roi de la Grande Brétagne</i>; for
which purpose they offered to send a minister hither,
where, too, might be one from the King of Prussia:
the ministers of <em>their</em> allies should assemble at Paris.
The two Empresses, they said, were grown more moderate
in their demands; and for their own part, they
talked of yielding to us all Canada. So much ear was
given to these overtures, that the Earl of Egremont<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
and Sir Joseph Yorke<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> were named to go to the Congress.
But so little was this measure to the inclination
of Mr. Pitt, that he prosecuted with unusual warmth
an expedition he had meditated against Belleisle; a
conquest of so little value, and so inadequate to the
expense with which it was attended, that the plan was
by many believed calculated solely to provoke the Court
of France, and break off the negotiation. France was
more surprised than concerned at this attack. Sir
Edward Hawke had lain before it for two years, when
there were not five hundred men on the island, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
attempting it. Now they had had time to fortify
it, we persisted in the conquest. Both Hawke and
Boscawen<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> earnestly dissuaded the enterprise. Yet
Pitt was obdurate; and the island was taken at last
by the beginning of June, after an enormous waste
of money, and the loss of some men. There fell Sir
William Williams, a gallant and ambitious young
man, who had devoted himself both to war and politics.
The island is a barren rock; and it was only to
humour Mr. Pitt, that France, in the succeeding negotiations,
condescended to treat it as an object of the
smallest importance.</p>

<p>The indecent and injudicious precipitation with
which the Favourite’s faction hurried towards peace,
justified any steadiness Mr. Pitt could exert to keep
the balance where he had placed it, in our own hands.
Newcastle and Hardwicke, either not perceiving the
symptoms of their own fall, or hoping to ward off the
evil hour, truckled to the Favourite’s views. The
Duke of Bedford (who in his heart admired Pitt, but
was made to hate him by Rigby, at the instigation of
Fox, and inflamed by the coldness with which Pitt
had listened to the representations made by his Grace,
on the opposition to him in Ireland) was, avowedly,
pacific; and all of them seemed united against the
warlike minister. Lord Talbot went so far as to press
the dismission of him. But it was Lord Bute’s nature
to provoke first, before he offended. Gallitzin, the
Russian minister, was reprimanded by him for carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the proposition of peace to Mr. Pitt, instead of to
him; though it had been usual, while Lord Holderness
held the Seals, for the foreign ministers in his department
to address themselves to the effective minister.
Mr. Pitt’s temper, soured by these associations
and contradictions, broke out first against the Duke of
Newcastle. At a great council held on the 23rd of
April, Mr. Pitt, who had been wont to affirm, that too
much could not be spent on the war in Germany,
made severe complaint of the extravagance in the
management of it; and imputed it to the fault of our
commissaries, that Prince Ferdinand had been disabled
from making greater progress there. Himself, he said,
within six months, would move for an inquiry into the
conduct of the war. The Duke of Bedford took up
the contrary side with warmth, and made a speech that
was much admired; and so little attention was paid to
the views of Mr. Pitt, that it was settled Mr. Stanley<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
and Monsieur de Bussy should be exchanged to conduct
the negotiation. Bussy was an Abbé of parts,
who had formerly resided here as minister,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> and had
given much offence to the late King whom he treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
so impertinently, that the King, asking him one day
in the circle, “Ce qu’il y avoit de nouveau à Paris?”
Bussy replied with contemptuous familiarity, “Sire, il
y gêle.” He had again been imposed on that Prince,
when the French dictated to him a neutrality for
Hanover. Bussy was not likely to be so presumptuous
now. Yet France, trusting to our pusillanimous
impatience for peace, had the confidence to
demand, that the man-of-war that carried over Stanley
should bring back Bussy. But Mr. Pitt was yet
minister; the proposal was rejected; and it was settled
that Stanley and Bussy should be at Dover and
Calais on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Before the departure of Stanley, it was agitated
in Council, whether he should be entrusted with full
powers. Mr. Pitt, who had named Stanley from opinion
of his abilities, though at that time disunited from
him and gone over to Newcastle, confided in this nomination,
and thought it would leave himself master of
the negotiation, if Stanley, who by being at Paris was
in his department, were charged with conclusive powers;
for which, therefore, Pitt and Lord Temple pleaded.
But Bute, and the rest of the Council, who chose not
to let the negotiation pass out of their own hands, prevailed
to have Stanley’s instructions limited.</p>

<p>During these discussions died two considerable
men, Archibald Duke of Argyle, and Hoadley Bishop
of Winchester. The character of the former<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
been sufficiently set forth in my preceding Memoirs.
The last will be known by his writings, and as long as
a Churchman, combating for the liberties of mankind,
shall be an unusual phenomenon.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> Argyle had the
lowest opinion of his nephew, Lord Bute, who he had
foretold would rush into power without having formed
a plan. The nephew had in truth too little capacity,
and too much presumption, to let himself be guided by
so shrewd a relation, though the uncle would not have
been obdurate if proper deference had been paid to
his oracle. The last effort of this great Lord’s power
in Scotland had miscarried. The city of Edinburgh
had recurred, as usual, to his nomination for the election
of their representative; that is, of thirty-three
electors, twenty-two still acknowledged their ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
dictator. He named Forester, an able Scottish counsellor,
but always resident in England. Six days before
the election such violent papers were dispersed
against Forester, as too much an Englishman, that the
City did not dare to put him in nomination, but were
forced to choose their own Provost. How much did
Scotland afterwards resent parallel nationalities, when
exercised against them!</p>

<p>The Marquis of Tweedale<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> succeeded the Duke of
Argyle, as Chief Justiciary; and Bishop Thomas, of
Salisbury, the King’s former preceptor, was made
Bishop of Winchester. Drummond,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> of St. Asaph,
whom Newcastle had destined to Winchester, succeeded.
Thomas Earl Powis was made Comptroller
of the Household on the death of Lord Edgcumbe.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>While the attention of mankind hung on the
negotiation, the King’s messengers were suddenly sent
forth to all Privy Councillors to meet at one o’clock,
at St. James’s, July 8th, on urgent and important business.
The business itself was an absolute secret.
Every body concluded that so solemn and unusual a
summons of the Council was to give fuller sanction to
peace. How great was the general surprise when they
heard his Majesty had convened this assembly to notify
his intended marriage with the Princess of Mecklenberg
Strelitz! A resolution taken and conducted
with so much mystery, that till that hour perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
not six men in England knew such a princess existed.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned with what aversion the Princess
Dowager had opposed a marriage projected by
the late King between his heir apparent and a very
accomplished Princess of Brunswick. A wife for her
son, not chosen by herself nor obliged to her, by no
means suited the views of the Princess. Could she
have chained up his body, as she fettered his mind,
it is probable she would have preferred his remaining
single. A mistress would have been more tremendous
than a wife. The next brother, the Duke of York,
was not equally tractable, had expressed little reverence
for his mother, and much antipathy to her
favourite. If the King should die and leave even an
infant, a minority did not deprive the Princess of all
prospect of protracting her rule.</p>

<p>But there had happened circumstances still more
pressing, more alarming. The King was fallen in love
with Lady Sarah Lenox, sister of the Duke of Richmond;
a very young lady of the most blooming beauty,
and shining with all the graces of unaffected, but animated
nature. What concurred to make her formidable
to the mother and Favourite, was, her being under
the tutorage of Mr. Fox, her eldest sister’s<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> husband;
and in truth, she and her family spared no
assiduity to fix the young monarch’s heart. And
though Fox would probably not have been scrupulous
or delicate on the terms of cementing that union, the
King’s overtures were so encouraging, that Fox’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
views extended even to placing the young lady on the
throne. Early in the winter, the King told Lady
Susan Strangways,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> Mr. Fox’s niece, and the confidant
of Lady Sarah, that he hoped she (Lady Susan) would
not go out of town soon. She said, she should. “But,”
replied the King, “you will return in summer, for the
coronation?” Lady Susan answered, “I do not know;
I hope so.” “But,” said the King again, “they talk
of a wedding. There have been many proposals; but
I think an English match would do better than a foreign
one. Pray, tell Lady Sarah Lenox I say so.” The next
time Lady Sarah went to Court (and her family took
care that should not be seldom) the King said, “he
hoped Lady Susan had told her his last conversation.”</p>

<p>The Junto was not blind to these whispers and dialogues.
Lady Bute was instructed to endeavour to
place herself in the circle, and prevent them. And the
Princess Augusta marked her observation of what was
going forward to Lady Sarah herself, laughing in her
face, and trying to affront her. But Fox was not to be
so rebuffed. Though he went himself to bathe in the
sea (possibly to disguise his intrigues), he left Lady
Sarah at Holland House,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> where she appeared every
morning in a field close to the great road (where the
King passed on horseback) in a fancied habit, making
hay.</p>

<p>Such mutual propensity fixed the resolution of the
Princess. One Colonel Graeme was despatched in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
most private manner as a traveller, and vested with no
character, to visit various little Protestant Courts, and
make report of the qualifications of the several unmarried
Princesses. Beauty, and still less, talents,
were not, it is likely, the first object of his instructions.
On the testimony of this man, the golden apple
was given to the Princess of Mecklenburg; and the
marriage precipitately concluded. The ambassador
was too remarkable not to be farther mentioned.
This Graeme, then, was a notorious Jacobite, and had
been engaged in the late rebellion. On a visit he
made to Scotland, his native country, after this embassy,
David Hume, the historian, said to him, “Colonel
Graeme, I congratulate you on having exchanged the
dangerous employment of making Kings, for the more
lucrative province of making Queens.”</p>

<p>So complete was the King’s deference to the will of
his mother, that he blindly accepted the bride she had
chosen for him; though, to the very day of the council,
he carried on his courtship to Lady Sarah; and she
did not doubt of receiving the crown from him, till
she heard the public declaration of its being designed
for another. Yet, in confirmation of the trust he had
reposed in Lady Susan Strangways, himself appointed
Lady Sarah to be one of the bridemaids to the Queen.
Yet Lord Bute’s friends affected to give another
turn to the story; and insisted that the King had
never thought of Lady Sarah but for his mistress.
All, they affirmed, he had said to Lady Susan was, to
bid her ask Lady Sarah if she should like a place in
the family of the new Queen; that she had accepted
it; and that the King had destined her to be Mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
of the Robes. Her surprise and disappointment, however,
were too strongly marked to make this legend
credible. Lady Susan adhered to the truth of what
she had reported, in various examinations by her father
and uncle. And the resentment Lady Sarah expressed,
and which caused, as the Court said, her not being
placed about the new Queen, was proof enough on
which side the truth lay. The Junto persuaded the
King she was a bad young woman; but if she was,
what hindered her becoming his mistress? Was it
criminal to propose being his wife rather than his mistress?
And what became of the King’s boasted piety,
if he intended to place his mistress about his wife?
Some coquet attempts, which Lady Sarah afterwards
made to recover his notice, and her stooping to bear
the Queen’s train as bridemaid, did her more prejudice
than all that was invented against her. Pique
and extreme youth might excuse both; and her soon
after preferring a clergyman’s son to several great
matches, gave evidence that ambition was not a rooted
passion in her.</p>

<p>In my own opinion, the King had thoughts of her
as a wife; but wanted resolution to oppose his mother
and Lord Bute. Fortunately, no doubt, in this instance;
for the daughter of a subject, and the sister-in-law
of so ambitious and exceptionable a man as Fox,
would probably have been productive of most serious
consequences. To avoid returning to this topic, I will
only remember, that during the wedding-service, on
mention of Abraham and Sarah, the King could not
conceal his confusion. And the day following, when
everybody was presented to the Queen, Lord Westmoreland,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
old and dimsighted, seeing Lady Sarah in
the rich habit of bridemaid, mistook her for Queen,
and was going to kneel and kiss her hand.</p>

<p>But while the arrival of the Queen was expected,
and the approaching ceremonies of the wedding and
coronation engrossed the attention of the public,
affairs grew towards a serious crisis in the Cabinet.
Prince Ferdinand had opened the campaign with vivacity
and advantage, driving the French before him,
and seizing, or reducing them to destroy great part of
their magazines; a success that enabled him to form
the sieges of Ziegenhayn and Cassel. Marshal Broglio
was not disheartened or inactive; but re-assembling
his dispersed troops, he attacked the Hereditary
Prince, and routed the body under his command; in
consequence of which the sieges were raised, and
Prince Ferdinand retired, abandoning the whole country
of Hesse to the enemy. This advantage, it was
apprehended, would make France less eager for peace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Yet she continued the negotiation with much appearance
of warmth; and though she was far from bringing
all the facilities our Court wished for, the conclusion
of the treaty seemed to be rather impeded by
the loftiness and firmness of Mr. Pitt, than by the insincerity
of France. Still, as it afterwards appeared,
she had secret resources in reserve; nor could she fail
to hope but Mr. Pitt might be displaced, and her condition
mended, when the administration should fall
into the hands of men whose honour was not so much
concerned in the event of the war, and who had national
honour much less at heart. The transactions
have been printed, and will appear in every common
history. My part is to relate by what steps and intrigues
the negotiation was broken off.</p>

<p>In the end of August, the council had ordered their
ultimate concessions to be drawn and sent to France.
Mr. Pitt made the draught and carried it to Council.
The other ministers thought it spoke his sense, not
theirs; or rather, contained more of an ultimatum
than they were disposed to adhere to. In defence of
his own inflexibility, Mr. Pitt spoke largely on the
<em>haughtiness</em> of France.</p>

<p>Lord Hardwicke<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> said he approved our not submitting
to their haughtiness, and congratulated his country
in not having been behind hand with them in that
respect. Lord Granville<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> took the draught, and applauded
it exceedingly; said it deserved to be inserted
in the Acta Regia; but for his part he did not love fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
letters on business. He thought even bad Latin preferable
to good in negotiations.</p>

<p>These speeches raised Pitt’s choler; and with reason.
He had vindicated the honour of his country; and
now was supporting it with a dignity it had never
known since the days of Cromwell. He saw himself
abandoned and ridiculed by his master’s ministers;
but he was not a man to recoil before such adversaries.
If he had assumed an unwarrantable tone, his situation
might well justify it. He broke out with great asperity,
and told them dictatorially, they should not alter
an iota of the letter. Rhodomontade had been too
favourite a figure with Lord Granville to leave him
the dupe of it in another man. He himself had made
glory but a step to ambition, instead of making ambition
a footstool to glory. He neither admired Pitt’s
exalted diction, nor exalted views; and continuing to
canvass the point with him, said, he had understood
from Bussy—“From Bussy,” interrupted Pitt; “nor
you, nor any of you shall treat with Bussy: nobody
shall but myself.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford, whom the rest always summoned
when they wanted to combat Pitt and did not
dare, said, “he did not know why he was called to
council, if he was not at liberty to debate; and since
he was told they were not to be permitted to alter an
iota, he would come thither no more,” and retired.
Some of the others were less stout. Lord Bute said
little, but that he thought the King’s honour was concerned
in sticking to our own terms; and therefore
he should be for adhering to them. This short turn
in the Favourite produced a like sentiment in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
who waited on his nod. Besides Mr. Pitt and Lord
Temple, the Chancellor, Lord Halifax, and Lord Ligonier
assented to the Favourite’s opinion; Hardwicke,
Newcastle, Mansfield, and Granville adhered to the
softer method. The Duke of Devonshire remained,
who had uttered no opinion. At last he said, if they
were not permitted to alter the draught of the letter
(which implied his inclination to have it altered), he
should give no opinion. Mr. Pitt asked what he
should report to the King as his Grace’s advice? He replied
as he had said before, “he would give no opinion.”</p>

<p>Newcastle was alarmed, and jealous of the sudden
and unexpected turn Lord Bute had taken, but was
soon satisfied by his Lordship that he was in no connection
with Mr. Pitt; and, indeed, it is probable
that he had only been overawed, and had apprehended
being taxed by Pitt with any unpopular measure. On
the 25th, another council was held, to which, notwithstanding
his declaration, the Duke of Bedford returned.
He and Devonshire seemed to have no concern but
lest any wayward humour of Newcastle should be
crossed. Pitt at this council was more temperate, and
submitted to some small concessions.</p>

<p>On the 7th of September, the new Queen landed
at Harwich. Lord Harcourt,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> whose peace had been
made by Lord Talbot, had been sent to fetch her,
with the Duchesses of Ancaster<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> and Hamilton;<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
as an earnest of the prison prepared for her, and to
keep her in that state of ignorance which was essential
to the views of the Princess, they were forbidden
to see her alone. Her mother, who died during the
treaty of marriage, ordered her to put herself entirely
into the hands of the Princess. Mrs. Katherine
Dashwood,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> of a Jacobite family, and intimate of Lady
Bute, was destined to live in the palace. No privy
purse was allowed to the Queen, but Mr. Stone<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
received twenty thousand pounds a year to pay her
servants.</p>

<p>She had been educated in that strict course of piety,
which in Germany reaches to superstition; a habit in
which she was encouraged to such a degree, that when
the King visited his mother, which he soon, at the
desire of the Princess, began to do, without the Queen,
she was afraid of staying alone, and retired to her
two German women; her English ladies not being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
suffered to keep her company. Yet this weakness
seemed solely the result of a bad education. Her temper
appeared to be lively, and her understanding sensible
and quick. Great good-nature, set off by much
grace in her manner, recommended all she said. Her
person was small, and very lean, but well made. Her
face pale and homely, her nose something flat, her
mouth very large. Her hair was of a fine brown, and
her countenance pleasing.</p>

<p>When first she saw the palace she trembled. The
Duchess of Hamilton smiled. The Queen said, “You
may laugh; you have been married twice; but it is
no joke to me.” The King received her in the garden
of St. James’s; she would have kneeled, but he
raised and embraced her, and led her to the Princess,
where they and Lady Augusta dined together. Between
nine and ten at night they went to chapel. The
Duke of Cumberland gave her away; and after the
ceremony they appeared for a few minutes in the
drawing-room, and then went to supper. She played
and sung, for music was her passion, but she loved
other amusements too, and had been accustomed to
them; but excepting her music, all the rest were
retrenched; nor was she<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> ever suffered to play at
cards, which she loved. While she was dressing, she
was told the King liked some particular manner of
dress. She said, “Let him dress himself; I shall dress
as I please.” They told her he liked early hours; she
replied, she did not, and “qu’elle ne voulait pas se
coucher avec les poules.” A few weeks taught her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
how little power she had acquired with a Crown. The
affection she conceived for the King softened the
rigour of her captivity. Yet now and then a sigh
stole out, and now and then she attempted, though in
vain, to enlarge her restraint. What must have penetrated
deeper, was, that policy did not seem to be the
sole motive of the mortifications she endured. At
times there entered a little wantonness of power into
the Princess’s treatment of her. The King made her
frequent presents of magnificent jewels; and as if diamonds
were empire, she was never allowed to appear in
public without them. The first time she received the
sacrament, she begged not to wear them, one pious
command of her mother having been, not to use
jewels at her first communion. The King indulged
her; but Lady Augusta carrying this tale to her mother,
the Princess obliged the King to insist on the
jewels, and the poor young Queen’s tears and terrors
could not dispense with her obedience.</p>

<p>Previous to the Coronation the vacant Bishopricks
were bestowed. The Archbishoprick of York was
given to Dr. Drummond;<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> and Hayter<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> of Norwich,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
who had been disgraced with Lord Harcourt, was, by
the interest of the same patron, Lord Talbot, promoted
to the See of London. Newcastle vehemently opposed
it, and solicited for Thomas of Lincoln,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> but received
this thundering sentence from Lord Bute:—“If Thomas
is such a favourite with your Grace, why did not
you prefer him when you had the power?” The Duke,
however, obtained the mitre of Norwich for Dr. Yonge;
and being bidden to observe that the King’s answer to
the address of Oxford on his marriage was kinder than
that to Cambridge, he replied, it is true; but two of
the new Bishops are Cambridge men—so easily did he
comfort himself even with the shadow of power!</p>

<p>Here ended, almost as soon as it began, the credit of
Lord Talbot. He was sometimes well, sometimes ill
with Lord Bute, and though remaining in favour at
Court, never seemed to have any influence there. A
trifling circumstance, because it occasioned an event
that made much noise afterwards, must be mentioned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
As Lord Steward, Lord Talbot composed part of that
ridiculous pageant at the coronation, the entry of the
Champion. So fond was Lord Talbot of his share in
this mummery, that he rehearsed his part on his steed
in Westminster-hall, and carried his new Bishop of
London to be witness of his feats. The Duke of York
calling Hayter, who was lame, up to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">haut pas</i>,
which he ascended with difficulty, the Bishop said,
“You see, sir, how hard it is for me to get a step.”
When the day came, Lord Talbot piqued himself on
not turning his back to the King, and produced a
strange hubbub of laughter by trying to force his horse
to retire backwards out of the hall. With the City,
with the Knights of the Bath, and the Barons of the
Cinque Ports, Lord Talbot had various squabbles, by
retrenching their tables at the coronation. Beckford
told him it was hard if the citizens should have no
dinner, when they were to give the King one, which
would cost them ten thousand pounds. This menace
prevailed. Sir William Stanhope, brother of Lord
Chesterfield, a man of not less wit, and of more ill-nature
than his elder, said, “It was an affront to the
Knights of the Bath; for <em>some</em> of us,” added he, “are
<em>gentlemen</em>.” It was a more bitter speech he made
against the Scotch and their Protectress. “He would
not go to Court,” he said, “for fear of the itch, which
would reduce him to go to the Princess’s Court for
brimstone.” To the Barons of the Cinque Ports Lord
Talbot said, “If they came to him as Lord Steward,
their request could not be granted; if, as Lord Talbot,
he was a match for any of them.” This boisterous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
and absurd behaviour drew aside much odium
from the Favourite; but as puppet-shows were not
exhibited every day, the zany was forgotten, and the
hisses of the mob soon fastened on the principal
performer.</p>

<p>It was not without reason that the nation took an
alarm, when almost all who conducted our affairs were
determined to take none. Spain for some time had
interposed officiously in behalf of France, which, said
the Spaniards, was sufficiently humbled, and must not
be ruined. It was known that they had furnished her
with money; and, as if they sought an open breach
with us, they demanded for all Spain the same privilege
as Biscay and two other provinces enjoyed, of
fishing on the coasts of Newfoundland. This was
peremptorily refused; and had Mr. Pitt’s influence
been equal to his spirit, Lord Bristol<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> had been immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
recalled from Madrid. But the other ministers,
who desired nothing better than an excuse for their
pusillanimity, begged to temporize. They pretended
to dread being overpowered, but were more afraid of
a new field being opened to success. The Spanish
ministers of the French faction had blown up their
opinionative and ignorant Prince<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> with ideas of holding
the balance between England and France: but the
old Spaniards lamented a system so abhorrent from the
true interest of their country. The King of Spain was
possessed with a notion that his lights were equal to
his grandeur. He listened, or thought he listened, to
no advice: but if anything is more fatal to a nation
than a foolish indolent Prince, it is a foolish one that
is active and obstinate. Our ministers cried out
against a war with Spain as unnatural; but when the
interest of Spain did not direct Spain, were we to act
as if it did? The Duke of Bedford, who, like Don
Carlos, could be made to take half of what he meant
for the whole, was clamorous against a Spanish war;
and as he always compensated for the arguments he
leaped over, by excess on the other side, he told Bussy
he was sorry for his departure, as we were no longer
in a situation to make war.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>Bussy, however, still lingered, and invented frivolous
excuses to palliate his delay. Lord Hardwicke,
considering a treaty in the light of a bill in Chancery,
begged some <em>binding</em> words might be inserted in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
treaty. But Mr. Pitt had fixed his resolution. It was
by one bold stroke to assert the honour of his country,
or to quit the rudder. He insisted that a fleet of
twelve or fourteen men-of-war should be instantly sent
to Cadiz; and that Lord Bristol should be ordered to
demand a sight of the treaty between Spain and
France; and if not accorded, to leave Madrid without
delay. When Spain had given such indications of her
partiality to France, nothing could be more justifiable
than this measure. But Spain had not restrained herself
within the bounds of favour. In the midst of the
negotiation between us and France, to which Spain
pretended to offer herself as guarantee, she had committed
a most flagrant and unheard-of instance of
taking part, nay, of adding herself as a party to the
grievances complained of. Bussy, tolerated here as
a negotiator, and without even a character from his
own Court, presented to Mr. Pitt a cavalier note in the
name of Spain, demanding restitution of some prizes
we had made on Spain during the war, satisfaction for
the violation of their territory by the navy of England,
liberty of fishery on Newfoundland, and destruction
of our settlements on the Spanish territory, in the
bay of Honduras. A power in amity with us, and
affecting to act as mediator, selects our enemy’s agent
to convey their complaints!—what could surpass this
insult?—the patience of our ministers under such
indignity—not of Mr. Pitt. He replied with the majesty
of the Crown he served,—the vengeance of that
Crown slept in other hands.</p>

<p>His hands tied, the nation affronted, and duped by
the partial breaking off of the treaty with France, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
proper resentment permitted against Spain, Mr. Pitt
found he could do no farther good. His character
had been lost by acquiescence; and nothing could
rouse the nation, but his quitting the sphere of business,
where he was so treacherously controlled. He
had desired to enter his protest in the council books
against the temporizing advice of his colleagues. He
and Lord Temple delivered to the King their reasons
and advice for a war with Spain; and October 2nd
Mr. Pitt took leave of the Council, thanking the
ministers of the late King for the support they had
given to the war; and on the fifth he resigned
the Seals. Lord Temple quitted on the ninth following.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say which exulted most on this
occasion, France, Spain, or Lord Bute, for Mr. Pitt
was the common enemy of all three. Newcastle,
Hardwicke, Bedford, Devonshire, Mansfield and Fox
were not less pleased,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> for they had all concurred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
thwart his plan. Lord Talbot alone, though of the
same faction, seemed to see farther than any of them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
He advised the Duke of Newcastle, “not to die for joy
on the Monday, nor for fear on the Tuesday.”</p>

<p>The nation was thunderstruck, alarmed, and indignant.
The City of London proposed to address the
King to know why Mr. Pitt was dismissed? but it
being replied, that the King would tell them he had
not dismissed Mr. Pitt, but had wished him to continue
in employment, the motion dropped. Some
proposed a general mourning; others, more reasonable,
to thank Mr. Pitt for his services; but this too was
damped; for the Favourite’s agents were not idle, and
insinuated that Mr. Pitt had acted with mischievous
views; for they who were incapable of great views,
were excellent in undermining. The King was advised
to heap rewards on his late minister. The Princess
pressed it eagerly. A peerage, a vast pension,
the government of Canada (as a mark that it was not
to be restored at the peace), were offered to him. He
had the frailty to accept a peerage for his wife, and a
pension of three thousand a year for three lives!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
The Court, impatient to notify their triumph, and to
blast his popularity at once, could not resist the impulse
of publishing in the very next night’s Gazette, Mr.
Pitt’s acceptance of their boons<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>—the first instance, I
believe, of a pension ever specified in that paper.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> At
the same time, to decry his councils, and to stigmatize
them with rashness, they added an article from
Spain, setting forth the pacific intentions of that
Court. But in this instance their ardour outran their
discretion, for the article published was dated September
4th. Other letters had been received from
thence of the 8th, which not being divulged, implied
that the letters of the 8th were of a hostile cast, and
consequently justified Mr. Pitt’s sentiments. Subsequent
events were a still clearer vindication of his
conduct.</p>

<p>The Seals, which Mr. Pitt had resigned, were given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
to Lord Egremont; and his brother-in-law, George
Grenville, was entrusted with the management of the
House of Commons. Grenville had been destined for
Speaker; an office to which his drudgery was suited;
and which being properly the most neutral place in
government, would have excused him from entering
into the contest between Mr. Pitt and the Favourite.
But Grenville’s temper, though plodding and laborious,
had not the usual concomitant, prudence. He lent
himself to the views of Lord Bute, to promote his
own. Lord Temple, who had as little decency as his
brother George had judgment, was exasperated beyond
measure; broke out in bitter invectives against him,
and threatened to leave from him the paternal estate
and give it to James, the third brother, who had resigned
with him and Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>The public, though staggered by the pension, did
not abandon their idol. At first the Common Council,
which had been summoned to thank him for his
services, dropped the intention, and separated, after
voting an address to Parliament for widening the
streets. But on one hand, Lord Temple’s zeal kept
alive the flame; and on the other, the rancour with
which Lord Bute’s and Fox’s partisans pursued Mr.
Pitt, only served to alarm the nation, and to endear
the man to them who they saw suffered for his patriotism.
Yet his own conduct was not judicious. Incensed
at the abuse thrown on him, he wrote a letter
into the City to explain his resignation, pleading that
he had no longer been allowed to <em>guide</em>. A term so
engrossing gave offence, and handle to ridicule. Fox’s
agents did not overlook it, but published some cutting
pamphlets on Pitt’s arrogance. Yet his condescending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
to appeal to the City against the Court bore down
all opposition. The Common Council agreed to thank
him, and to instruct their members; and though Paterson,
an agent of Fox, opposed the motion, it was carried
by 109 to 15. The contagion soon spread, even
to part of Scotland. Stirling, Exeter, York, Chester,
and other cities and towns, complimented Mr. Pitt on
his conduct.</p>

<p>His own sister, Mrs. Anne Pitt, who was of the
opposite faction, furnished his enemies with a severe
sarcasm. She had been Maid of Honour to Queen
Caroline, and was warmly attached to her brother,
with whom she lived. On his promotion to the Pay-office,
he had shaken her off in an unbecoming manner.
She had excellent parts and strong passions. Lord
Bolingbroke had recommended her to the late Prince,
on whose death she had been made Privy-purse to the
Princess: but being of an intriguing and most ambitious
nature, she soon destroyed her own prospect
by an impetuosity to govern her mistress, and by embarking
in other Cabals at that Court. Her disgrace followed,
but without dismission; on which she had retired
to France. On her return, though she could never
recover the favour of the Princess, she so successfully
cultivated the patronage of Lord and Lady Bute, that
she kept her ground at Leicester Fields, and obtained
a large pension. This she had notified by letter to her
brother. He had coldly replied, that he congratulated
her on the addition to her fortune, but was grieved to
see the name of Pitt in a list of pensions.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> On his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
accepting one, she copied his own letter, turning
it against himself; and though restrained by her
friends from sending it to him, she repeated what
she had done, till it became the common talk of the
town.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of November the Parliament met.
George Grenville made a very handsome panegyric on
the late Speaker; and then the House proceeded to
the election of his successor. The choice had been
very difficult: not from the number of competitors,
but from a total deficiency of proper subjects. Grenville,
who would have filled the chair with spirit and
knowledge, had been taken off to a province, for which
he was far less qualified. Lord Bute had solicited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Prowse<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> to accept the office, who was the most knowing
and the most moderate of the Tories, but he had
declined from bad health. The Duke of Newcastle
had proposed Bacon,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> who had more Whiggism than
abilities; but the Favourite determined on Sir John
Cust,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> who was a Tory, and had nothing but industry;
he was indeed a very poor creature. Lord Barrington
named him, his friend Lord Egmont praised him, and
he was chosen.</p>

<p>Two nights before, at a meeting of the principal
men in the House of Commons, to hear the King’s
Speech, and the respondent Address, read, Charles
Townshend, who was offended at the lead being assigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
to Grenville, found fault that there was no
mention of the militia. Grenville said, it was not
usual to insert anything in the Address which was not
touched upon in the Speech; and added, that he
found there were very different opinions in members
of Parliament on the usefulness of the militia. Lord
Barrington and Charles Yorke supported Grenville:
Stanley agreed with Townshend, who again debated
the point with much warmth. The next night, at a
larger meeting at the Cockpit, Townshend recanted to
Grenville all he had said, professed he believed he had
been infatuated, begged it might be forgotten, and
that Grenville would not take it to himself. Grenville
replied, he had not: that for himself he forgot it; as
the King’s servant, he could not forget it.</p>

<p>On the 6th, the King made his speech. Lord
Northumberland<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> and Lord Berkeley<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> of Stratton
moved and seconded the Address. Lord Temple rose,
and opened on his own and Mr. Pitt’s resignations,
the motives to which he explained; found fault that
no mention was made of the militia, and that the
Parliament had not been thanked for establishing it.
He talked on Court favour, and on those who disposed
of all things; endeavouring to provoke Lord Bute to
rise. He said, the crisis for a war with Spain had
been most advantageously held out to this country,
and complained of those who had betrayed the secrets
of our situation to Bussy. It was a time, he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
when a first minister was necessary; but now, <em>who</em> remained
fit for that office? <em>Who</em> thought himself capable
of <em>guiding</em>? He uttered this in his usual languid
manner, though the matter was not ill conceived;
nor, though indiscreet, was he so intemperate as had
been expected. The Duke of Bedford replied with
much applause, and said, he did not know why the
militia deserved more thanks than the grant of regular
troops. He declared,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> upon his honour, that he had
told no such thing, as had been hinted at, to Bussy;
and concluded with hoping never to see a first minister.
Lord Shelburne, attached to Fox, and profuse
of application to Lord Bute, spoke against the German
war. The Duke of Marlborough<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> and Earl Gower
moved the congratulation to the Queen.</p>

<p>The decency of Lord Temple’s prelude to new opposition
soon changed its hue in a manner more suited
to his factious turbulence. On the 9th, the King and
all the Royal family dined in the City with the Lord
Mayor. Thither, too, went Mr. Pitt and Lord Temple
in a chariot together,—a step justly censured, and very
nearly productive of fatal consequences. To <em>them</em> all
acclamations were addressed; and the distinctions paid
in the Guildhall to Mr. Pitt, to the total neglect of
the King, bestowed all the honour of the triumph on
the former. Little was wanting to turn the pageant
into a tragedy. Riots ensued, and many persons were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
insulted. The Favourite had taken the precaution of
having a guard of butchers and bruisers; and by the
defence of that convoy alone, escaped mischief. Sir
Samuel Fludyer, the Lord Mayor, caused diligent inquiry
to be made into the proceedings of the day, and
learned that Beckford himself had visited several public-houses
over night, and had appointed ringleaders
to different stations, and had been the first to raise
the huzza in the hall on the entrance of Mr. Pitt.
<em>His</em> joining himself to a pomp, dedicated to a Court
that he had just quitted, was not decent. The ambition
of drawing to himself the homage of the people
was not modest. To offer himself as an incentive to
civil tumult, and to how dangerous consequences he
could not tell, was not a symptom of very innocent intentions.</p>

<p>On the 13th of November the Address to the King
was moved in the House of Commons by the Lords
Middleton and Parker.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Mr. Wilkes,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> a man of
whom much will be said hereafter, passed some censures
on the King’s speech, which, in the language of
Parliament, he said, he was authorized to call the
speech of the minister; though of what minister he
could not tell. The extraordinary Gazette, he said,
which had vaunted the pacific disposition of Spain,
had been contradicted by facts: it had appeared that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
we were rather in a state of war with that Crown.
Yet no notice had been taken of those transactions in
the speech, though all mankind was apprised of their
notorious insults. He himself had seen a Spanish
memorial, that had been delivered by a French agent.
Unless some communication was made to Parliament,
how could Parliament lay the state of the nation
before his Majesty? As little mention, he observed,
was made of the militia, though the ground on which
the war had stood. Dempster,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> a young Scotch member,
seconded Wilkes, though less peremptory in opposition;
for though he pleaded for the extension of
the militia to Scotland, and said the militia had felt
the heavy hand of administration, yet he censured the
German war, as having neither object nor end; condemned
faction, and said, he was pleased to see that
his Majesty had emancipated himself from the chains
that had been prepared for him.</p>

<p>Beckford, with his usual rhodomontade, said, our
situation had never been so comfortable, nor the national
union ever so complete. It was not the mob,
nor two hundred great Lords (who received more from
Government than they paid to it), that made us so
firm: the middling rank of men it was in which our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
strength consisted, and who called upon us to demand
peace sword in hand. Nor had our abilities ever been
so great. He was astonished our ministers—who they
were he knew not, nor did he look on Grenville and
those in the House of Commons but as subalterns—were
afraid of any power upon earth: he was amazed
they could suffer such memorials from Spain, so derogatory
to our honour. The answer should have been
made by the mouth of cannon. The revenues of Spain
were pitiful, were foreign: must be brought home,—and
that we might have prevented. You are near
shore, continued he; will you go back? and without a
pilot? A King should not govern by a faction: the
late King had been governed by one, who resigned
in the midst of rebellion, and flung an empty purse in
his face; but we had now no Earl of Warwick, no
king-makers. Hope must come from the rising generation:
we had tried the old in vain. The war in Germany
<em>had</em> an object, and had almost obtained it. The
French ought to be kept there. He did not desire
to see France and England engaged single-handed.
France said, let us both get out of Germany, for she
felt the mischief of warring there. The manner indeed
in which we had conducted our affairs there, had
been too expensive; of which he produced instances:
but speak out, cried he; will you quit all your allies?
Two points must be obtained, the security of America
and of our fisheries. We had already conceded too
much: he was sorry for it—was sorry Mr. Pitt had
softened at all. He would be ready to second Mr.
Wilkes in moving for the Spanish papers, and to
know if they avowed Bussy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Beckford was answered by Cust<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> (the Speaker’s brother),
and by Harvey;<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> the last, a lawyer; both of Tory
families, and the latter very sensible. The former
spoke on the burthen of the war, and said, that to
raise six millions, we ran in debt two: this year would
cost us between nine and ten. He would appeal to
our very successes for the impropriety of continuing
the war. The King had told us he would never depart
from our true interest: if we never <em>had</em> departed
from it, we should not be debating now. Harvey condemned
the war in Germany, and justified the intentions
of Spain. Fuentes had declared, that if his
Court had had any hostile designs, it would itself have
made the demands; but the other end of the town,
said he, will always promote a Spanish war: had done
so in the last reign; had driven it on by the feigned
cruelties exercised on Captain Jenkins,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> who, however,
died with his ears on his head. Forester, another and
still shrewder lawyer, endeavoured to ward off the
rising spirit by showing there was no such question
before the House as what was then in debate, Wilkes
not having made any motion; (this was an usual art
in old members, and often served the purpose;) nor
was the militia more the subject of the debate, nor as
yet to come on. Thus was the House free from any
influence but of gratitude to the militia, as they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
been encamped without law, and only because we had
a greater war abroad than we could bear. He hoped
that night’s mail would not carry to the Continent
news of disunion in the new Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, on whom all eyes were fixed, rose; and
said, he wished the turn of the debate had permitted
him to sit still; but he found himself called upon. He
professed great zeal for his Majesty and for the administration,
when it should be settled; and was desirous
to leave his own justification to his past conduct.
For the militia, he should have been glad it had been
mentioned in the speech. He had advised that measure
last year against the greater part of the Cabinet
Council. For a war with Spain, the motives for it were
not founded on the French papers: those, he concluded,
would be published here: the silence of the ministers
made him conclude so, or it would be unfair dealing
with the Parliament. When those papers should appear,
he would as a member of Parliament speak his
opinion: did not desire on that question that any man
should think with him, but form his judgment on the
fact itself. As the contrary sentiment had been
adopted by his Majesty, he hoped not to have the
bulk of the nation on his side. God alone knew what
the opinion would be, when the whole should come
out. The probability was, that himself had been
erroneous. His own situation was awful; he stood
there to be <em>examined</em>—hoped the ministers would produce
the advice, signed by Lord Temple and him, and
delivered to his Majesty. He would conceal nothing
as far as was consistent with his oath of Privy Councillor.
Nor would he inflame—how could he—he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
who stood so unsupported? He had been taxed with
assuming to <em>guide</em>. He declared he had never abetted
the publication of his letter to Hodges—never had
consented to its publication; but now published, he
did avow it. Early he had contracted an indifference
to party-papers, and had rather read two passages in
Virgil or Horace. He had resigned the Seals, in order
not to be responsible for measures he was no longer
suffered to <em>guide</em>, and from seeing the question of
Spain in the light he saw it. He had acted from
conviction, as he supposed the great Lords, who had
opposed him, had done likewise. He blessed himself
that no question had been moved that day to bar
unanimity. All vigour was recommended from the
Throne: he would not have the post depart with many
arraignments of the German war, and without any minister
saying a word in its behalf. In their situation
he would have lain by: did they advise a speech of
vigour, and yet hold their peace, when vigorous measures
were condemned? Himself was never stopped
by popularity, or by the turn of the tide. He would
speak though a private man: hoped never to be a
public man again. He never would come into place
again; he never could; for he never could but by his
own accord. He had been nursed in the lap of fortune,
but now had not weight enough to make but
one Lord, with whom he would live and die, of his
opinion. Hoped his Majesty’s rest would not be disturbed,
as his had been: he had been robbed of his
sleep for many days, and now should be robbed of his
honour, if our troops were recalled from Germany.
Nothing but that spectre of an invasion, which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Ministry had not had constancy enough to look at,
had frightened us out of Mahon. So would it be
again, if the troops of France found themselves at
liberty to quit Germany. He had known five thousand
French occasion our recalling seventy or fourscore
thousand men to look them in the face. He
paid a handsome compliment to Admiral Hawke and
the navy; but said, ask the French whether they
could not engage you hand to hand, if delivered from
the war in Germany. The way to peace was not by
lessening our efforts. England was equal to both
wars, the American and the German; and if continued,
nothing but conquest would follow—all owing to the
German war. If we abandoned our allies, God would
abandon us. When we had spent a hundred millions,
should we throw away the fruit, rather than spend
twelve more? Let a man so narrow-minded stand
behind a counter, and not govern a kingdom. [This
was pointed at Cust, who was a director of the African
Company.] <em>America had been conquered</em> in <em>Germany.</em><a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
Prince Ferdinand had been the saviour of Europe,
and had shattered the whole military power of that
military monarchy, France. It was not from what
young members had said against the German war,
but from what had <em>not</em> been said for it, that he
augured ill for this country. He hoped so insignificant
a name as his would be sent to every hostile
Court; though every other man in the House should
be against the German war, he would stand single,
and undergo the shame. Government, he hoped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
would in due time lay open the proceedings of Spain,
lest gentlemen might be misled from not knowing
the precise time of the arrival of Fuentes.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> Harvey
was sure Spain could not have acted as alleged, yet
owned he knew nothing of the matter. But were
people to go away, thinking he himself had courted
a war with Spain? He might have declared his private
opinion in council; but let Parliament see the
whole of the negotiation: let them know his patience
and long-suffering, till he was afraid he should be
answerable for it. He gave a flat contradiction to the
notion of his having courted a war with Spain, and
protested he had done all he could to avoid it. He
had stated his opinion in writing, lest false whispers
from those who ought to be above such underhand
machinations, should prejudice him in the eyes of his
countrymen. In delicacy, not in obligation, he would
sit down rather than divulge what had passed. Yet
altercation, opposition would have ensued, had there
not been a determination to preserve unanimity. He
would even persuade gentlemen not to be too fastidious
in their criticisms on the Treasury and the
budget. For his relaxing on the article of the fisheries,
with which his friend Beckford had taxed him, he said,
it was best to own the truth; he had been overborne
by numbers. He and Lord Temple would have made
exclusive fisheries the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine quâ non</i> of the peace.
Were the negotiation to recommence, provided circumstances
concurred, he would stand for exclusive
fisheries; nor sheath the sword till they were given
up, even at the expense of another campaign. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
going to sit down, but added a few words on the note
of Fuentes, which, said he, that minister knows was
never remitted to me. He did read me an extract; it
was to the effect alleged. I did not much attend to
it; said I had written to Lord Bristol, and would let it
rest there. He did read something like it, but did not
deliver it.</p>

<p>This guarded, artful, and inflammatory speech remained
unanswered. George Grenville, indeed, said a
few words on the form of proceeding; as, that it would
be precluding those great questions, to insert them
either in the Speech or Address: and to justify Spain,
he read a letter in which they ordered one of our cutters
to be restored. As a rising minister he spoke
more largely on himself, disclaimed any ambition, and
professed he would do his duty without fear. The
Address passed without a negative. The next day
Lord Thomond<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> and Lord Villiers moved the Address
to the Queen, and on the 19th her dowry was
voted.</p>

<p>The secession of Pitt, and his popularity, that still
kept its ground, warned the administration to a closer
union. At least, the old ministers, who had separated
from him, thought it prudent to draw nigher to the
Favourite. The Duke of Devonshire, governed by
Fox, who hated Pitt, and aspired to be lieutenant to
Lord Bute, meditated a coalition of the latter with
Newcastle. The house of Bedford were already
devoted to the Favourite, and concurred in that connection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
In consequence of this conjunction, the Privy
Seal was delivered to the Duke of Bedford; great promises
were made to Rigby. Lord Thomond, brother-in-law
of Grenville, was appointed Cofferer; Lord
Powis,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Treasurer of the Household, and Lord George
Cavendish,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Comptroller.</p>

<p>On the 25th, at night, some forty persons, or fewer,
met at the St. Alban’s tavern, in Pall Mall. The Act
that had granted the militia was within a year of expiring.
It was become irksome to many of the country
gentlemen, was much disliked by the chief ministers,
and by great part of the House of Commons. The
friends of the measure had wished to get it renewed
for five years more. Some desired it perpetual. Pitt,
while minister, had staved off even the shorter term.
He now went to this meeting, spoke four times warmly
for the perpetuity, and said, this was the moment to
push it. Charles Townshend, who attended the meeting
too, spoke earnestly, but only for the term of five
years. The company signed a paper, engaging to
stand by one another in the measure; and they who
held commissions in the militia promised to throw
them up, if the perpetuity should not be carried,
agreeing only to await the arrival of General Townshend,
the patron of the plan, who was expected from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the army. The Court was as much set against the
militia. The Duke of Devonshire told George Grenville,
he believed he could not induce his own brothers
to vote for it. The very same day intelligence had
been received of an intended invasion from France.
Grenville, told the Duke he could not come into any
measure that would disband seven and twenty thousand
men, when we should have so much occasion for
them: it would be better to grant the perpetuity, and
repeal it afterwards.</p>

<p>The same morning, Charles Townshend,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> now Secretary
at War, moved for the land forces, which were
granted without opposition. His new office gave him
an opportunity of venting his vanity. He assumed
much, and called himself trustee for the honest claims
of the officers. On December 9th, he opened to the
House the state of the foreign troops in our pay, the
expense of which came to near a million. Townshend
pleaded the inconsiderable loss we had sustained in the
last campaign, not above two thousand men, which
would easily be recruited; and that next year, as in
the last four, we should cover our allies against any
force France could bring against us. Should we for
next year continue the same army, or break off abruptly?
The Parliament had been called upon day
after day to disapprove or ratify the measure; and had
ratified it. The totality of the war had been one of
the great causes of its success. Had we neglected any
other part for Germany, it had been fatal: but a mixed
system, and attention to the whole, had given us victory
in every quarter. France had resisted every where,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
had been disgraced every where. Their navy, the last
sanguine promise of still another minister, was annihilated.
We ought not to desist but from inability
to pursue up the blow. It ought to be manifest that
we were disabled. But where was a symptom of
decay? In our trade, credit, agriculture, where was a
failure? Yet he thought our situation nor comfortable,
nor desperate. Five millions he allowed would
be expended this year on the war in Germany. He
concluded with high encomiums on what he called
<em>Mr. Pitt’s divine plan</em>; but added, that a larger portion
of fame remained for those who should take up the
plan and terminate it by a good peace.</p>

<p>The Court, who wished to veil their eagerness for
peace, and who, instead of attaining that peace, were
on the brink of a war with Spain, took great pains to
prevent their creatures from openly attacking the German
war. Lord Egmont was persuaded to be absent
from the House; but Fox’s faction was more intent
on discrediting Pitt than even on paying their
court—and perhaps knew how easily they should be
forgiven. Rigby said he had voted for all very large
sums; was sorry he began to have a doubt; wished
an end was put—had been put to the whole war. The
Germans were entitled to the protection of the House,
but ours was no protection. They were in a worse
condition than if conquered. The treaty with Prussia
would expire on the 12th of the month; he hoped we
should make no more such with that <em>little power</em>. Not
to quit the alliance, ought only to be a condition on the
party subsidized. In no one treaty did there exist an
article that obliged us to continue our national troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
in Germany. Nor could we supply our army with
men; since 1758, we had sent over twenty-nine thousand
men. We had but thirteen thousand remaining.
Could this country furnish four thousand men a year
to Germany? Marshal Ligonier had ordered the old
corps to be recruited at any rate. We had three
thousand sick in hospitals, and were reduced to send
boys of ten years old—a good way to make the war
last! He spoke, he said, neither from fickleness nor
discontent; was very well contented; had tried to
swallow the measure, but found it would not do. If
these troops had been brought home, we might have
disbanded the militia. Wished he could see the negotiation
for peace renewed; wished even a bad peace
was offered. He concluded the French account of
the rupture was authentic, or would have been contradicted.
He spoke, he said, to the country gentlemen;
<em>they</em> were not included in the picture of our
<em>comfortable</em> situation. If so much was given to glory,
their cups of comfort would not be drunk so often as
they used to be. Sir Robert Walpole, whom he
thought the greatest minister that this country had
known, had always declared the nation could not stand
under a debt exceeding an hundred millions.</p>

<p>Stanley defended the measure of pursuing the German
war, and said it was evident from every page of
the printed negotiation that France wished to get out
of Germany; that she was not equal to both wars, and
had therefore neglected everything to make her
push there, hoping it would exasperate the people of
England against Hanover. That none of our allies
were in a situation to make conquests, and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
we must part with some of ours, to obtain tolerable
conditions for them.</p>

<p>George Grenville supported the question solely on
the foot of treaties, which he recapitulated, but took
care to assert that he had neither advised nor approved
them; he had not been able, he said, to stop a torrent;
let those who had given the advice drink the
dregs! he did not desire to steal the fame due to another.
It had not been the German war, but the want
of seamen, that had disabled France from prosecuting
the war in America and from invading England. Let
us know what had been the obstacle that had broken
off the treaty. An immense load of debt had been
laid upon us; he would not call on any light of Government,
who had brought us into these distresses,
to help us out of them. If they had overlooked
these things, he must be sorry. But our honour was
pledged, and he would not be for an ignominious
peace; nor, on the other hand, would he intoxicate
the people with unattainable objects. He would not
hang out our distresses; to know them was the first
point; to conceal them, the second.</p>

<p>Thus were hostilities openly commenced by Grenville.
He had during the last reign avowedly or silently
supported every one of Pitt’s expensive German
measures. Indeed he had held by Pitt’s favour one
of the most lucrative places under the Government,
the Treasurer of the Navy. The scene was changed,
and Grenville with it.</p>

<p>Pitt replied in a long speech, but with much temper,
which he professed he would keep, though so
marked out; but in contempt of Grenville, he affected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
chiefly to answer Rigby, falling into the familiar, and
not in a masterly style; desiring to expostulate, not to
altercate on who was in or out of place; but considering
himself as in a council of state, engaged to find
out the point of truth, and how to wind up the war.
He complimented our troops, whom he called <em>the glory
of human nature</em>, and Charles Townshend on his moderation
and clear method of stating the question. If
Rigby, he said, had had communication of papers, he
must have seen the distresses of France, but would
advise him to reconsider his positions, before he published
his political code, before he should come <em>to guide</em>—but
begged pardon for his levity; he chose to be in
good humour, for fear of being in bad. He would
not enter into the wretched consideration of what himself
had done. Grenville had treated his counsels
as pernicious—nobody indeed had asserted it—somebody
did shrewdly convey it—for his part he liked
better a man that affirmed. Grenville, however,
would not entirely take away the lustre of this measure,
already more than half exploded by the King’s
servants. Himself, an individual, had been called,
compelled to the service; he had found this measure
bound on upon the nation, both by the concluding and
breaking the treaty of Closter Severn. It was an
electoral measure, not advised, but submitted to in
silence by the piety of the Duke of Cumberland.
The subsidy to Prussia had been dictated by Hanover,
not by Great Britain. Little Princes are subsidized,
when not worthy of reciprocation; but necessity had
driven that great Prince to accept our money; yet his
Prussian Majesty did not think that he thereby lost his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
equality of not being deserted. Both the Empresses
had received subsidies from us. He himself, he said,
had resisted the measures of the closet, nor would subscribe
to them till qualified. His late gracious master
had suffered his representations; and he had boldly
urged them, fearing our own defence and America
would be neglected; nor would he agree to the German
war till every other service had been provided for.
Was it candid, was it just, to throw the whole burthen
on him, who had been but an acceder to a plan settled?
an acceder to a ministry that had wanted vigour.
He had <em>borrowed their majority</em> to carry on their own
plan. He had seen where they had been right, where
wrong. He had brought the American war, and
taken up the German; had seen that we must be
strong enough to baffle France, or should do nothing.
France had been <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dedecorum pretiosus emptor</i>. It was
true our expense had been great, and he offered himself
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">confitentem reum</i>, if he had not thereby annihilated
their power both in East and West Indies. Perhaps
he had done it the wrong way; and Mr. Grenville
could have done it some other way. The business,
however, was done, by whatever way done; and he
would now divide the House alone against abandoning
our allies. Relaxation could only invite inflexibility
in our enemies; nor ought we to give the money, and
at the same time blast the measure. As Germany had
formerly been managed, it had been a millstone about
our necks; as managed now, about that of France.
Let a man get possession of the Government, and act
as late ministers had acted, and he would endeavour
to make his heart ache. Now we were leagued with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
the King of Prussia, who was born to administer military
wonders to the world; his motto should be <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">adversis
rerum immersabilis undis</i>. To him was added
Prince Ferdinand, for whom he could not find adequate
words. That great Prince had stood like a rampart
to cover Germany—and at last, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">comperit invidiam
supremo fine domari</i>.</p>

<p>Legge spoke a few words in praise of the measure,
and against abandoning our allies; and the debate
ended without a division.</p>

<p>The recapitulation of many speeches may perhaps
weary the reader, but, in equity, he must remember
that at this period at least it was essential to detail
them. When Mr. Pitt was driven from the management
of the war, he existed as a public man; but in
his speeches and past services, his own defence of his
measures was necessary from his own mouth. Libels
on libels were published against him, and he wrote
none. I am sensible that I do not do justice to his
arguments, and less to his eloquence; but what I give
was faithfully taken from his own mouth in the House
of Commons; and unless better transcripts appear,
this rude sketch may be welcome to posterity. No
flattery is intended to him. When I thought him
blameable, I have marked it, as will appear hereafter,
with the same impartiality. The debates, too, of a free
nation, arrived at the summit of its glory, may be
worthy the attention of future times. Our descendants
will see what their ancestors were in arms and
eloquence, and what liberty they enjoyed of discussing
their own interests. Grant, Heaven, they may not read
it with a sigh; reading it in bondage and ignominy!</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt’s enemies did not content themselves with
traducing him in pamphlets and satires. A deeper
blow was meditated, which, though not carried to the
extent which the projectors hoped, could not but
wound his mind, and did to a degree lower him in the
opinion of some men, though the brutality with which
it was conceived and executed, raised almost general
indignation. I will just touch the surprize it wrought
on me, which may convey some idea of what effect it
must have had on others.</p>

<p>The report on the foreign troops was made the day
after they had been removed. Mr. Bunbury,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
married Lady Sarah Lenox, had spoken, for the first
time in Parliament, against the German war. Lord
George Sackville, with more caution, but no less hostile
intention to Pitt, had declared for the measure,
as no alternative was proposed, though he hoped ministers
would concert with our allies how to draw us
out of this scrape. He did not believe that France
was in a worse situation than she had been at Gertruydenburg,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>
when she rejected insolent terms. She
could, besides, subsist her troops on easier terms than
we could. She brought to account the contributions
raised by her armies; he did not know that we did.
Lord George was finishing his speech as I came into
the House. My ear was struck with sounds I had
little been accustomed to of late, virulent abuse on
the last reign, and from a voice unknown to me. I
turned, and saw a face equally new; a black, robust
man, of a military figure, rather hard-favoured than
not young, with a peculiar distortion on one side of
his face, which it seems was owing to a bullet lodged
loosely in his cheek, and which gave a savage glare
to one eye. What I less expected from his appearance,
was very classic and eloquent diction, and as
determined boldness as if accustomed to harangue in
that place. He told the House that in the late
King’s reign we had been governed solely by Hanoverian
measures and councils; and though called to
order (in truth unparliamentarily), he proceeded with
the same vociferous spirit to censure all ministers but
Lord Bute; and for Mr. Pitt, who was not present,
he received the appellation of a profligate minister,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
who had thrust himself into power on the shoulders of
the mob. The present King, said this new Court-tribune,
was so English, that he did not believe he had
looked into the map for Hanover;<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> and he commiserated
the present ministers, who were labouring
through the dregs of German councils.</p>

<p>The reader must imagine the astonishment occasioned
by this martial censor. He was a Colonel
Barré, of French extraction, born at Dublin, and had
served for some years in the war in America with
reputation, prosecuting his studies with assiduity in
the intervals of duty. With General Wolfe he had
been intimately connected, both as an officer and
penman; but had thought himself ill-used by Mr.
Pitt, though the friends of the latter, and Lord Barrington,
lately Secretary at War, bore witness that Mr.
Pitt had made it a point to serve him. In his younger
years he had acted plays with so much applause,
that, it was said, Garrick had offered him a thousand
pounds a year to come upon the stage.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>This man, therefore, had been selected by Lord
Fitzmaurice (become Earl of Shelburne by the death
of his father) as a bravo to run down Mr. Pitt. Lord
Shelburne held a little knot of young orators at his
house; but Barré soon overtopped them; and Fox had
pushed on the project of employing him to insult Pitt—to
what extent was surmised by all the world. The
consequences will appear in the next debate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Glover,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> the author of “Leonidas,” uttered a speech
in most heroic fustian, but not without good argument,
to show that all our great advantages had been obtained
before we went deeply into the German war.
Charles Yorke, Attorney-General, defended the measures
of the late King against Barré and his own
friend Mauduit’s pamphlet, urging that his Majesty
had reduced himself to poverty to support the war in
Germany. Elliot made an admirable oration to reconcile
himself to consistence: owned he had opposed
the treaties in 1755; and was then told they were
calculated to prevent a war in Germany. He had
since been dazzled with the national enthusiasm on the
King of Prussia’s victories, and confessed that on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
like appearances he should again be led to approve the
German war. It was true that war had its object,
collateral division; but would the House wish to Germanize
this young King, and make him turn his
thoughts thither more than he did? He concluded
with a pathetic ejaculatory wish that the peace had
succeeded.</p>

<p>Oswald<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> took the same turn of endeavouring to
palliate his inconsistencies; but though his parts were
still shrewder and quicker than Elliot’s, he did it much
worse. Dr. Hay<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> attempted, too, an apology for himself,
but with the worst success of the three; and the
necessity which the principal men in Parliament found
themselves under of justifying their abandoned corruption
and versatility, stamped disgrace on this Parliament
itself, which it did but increase by fresh and
repeated instances of servility in ensuing sessions on
every change of Administration.</p>

<p>The next day, Dec. 11th, Mr. Cooke<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> moved for all
memorials relating to our fisheries, &amp;c., which he introduced
by saying, he wished to know what was the
state of our affairs with regard to Spain—he hoped
peaceable; but desired to see the papers relating to
their claims, and to know if they had treated us with
contempt and disdain. Beckford seconded him, urging
that the Gazette and Bussy’s memorial contradicted
one another. The King had asked advice of Parliament:
if ministers should refuse these papers, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
refused to comply with the King’s request. He did
not know who were the ministers, nor whether we had
a single minister, or a minister depute. It was necessary
to have <em>one</em> minister.</p>

<p>Grenville replied, that though he had heard of this
motion, he could not believe it would be made. It
was our right to have papers, when essentially necessary;
but power of negotiation belonged to the
Crown; and negotiations ought not to be made public,
when real mischief might be the consequence. Had
his Majesty asked advice as to Spain? would you
ground advice on those papers? or were they wanted
to answer newspapers? Should a minister or minister
depute make that answer? He had heard with surprise
that <em>one</em> man ought to direct. What had been
the constant charge against Sir Robert Walpole, but
his acting as sole minister? Yet his modesty had
declined the appellation. Prime Minister was an
odious title: he was sorry it was now thought an
essential part of the constitution. He did believe the
Gazette had contained, word for word, the sense of
the dispatch. The assurances of a peaceable disposition
had been given, but who could answer that they
were to be depended upon? It would be breach of
trust to communicate the papers demanded without
particular leave; nor, should they be communicated,
would they be sufficient ground for advice. Would
the House, if they contained offensive words, lay them
before the public to inflame the people? The subject
was not fit at that hour for the intervention of
Parliament. If ministers are called upon, and tell our
distresses, they are repeated abroad: if silent, are supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
to allow them. There was no reason to suspect
the King of exercising his power improperly.</p>

<p>Lord Strange said, he had not believed that any
men would be so hardy as to bring on this affair, and
thought they could not word it so as to obtain his
assent: but the motion was now so unexceptionable,
that he could not object to it. No letters of a private
nature were demanded. The House had a right to
tender its advice, even unasked. Who doubted but
Spain had communicated all those papers to France?
Yet ministers would not produce them to Parliament.
They were divided amongst themselves; therefore the
people ought to interpose. By showing no confidence
to the people, the administration would destroy their
zealous attachment to the Crown.</p>

<p>Wilkes maintained that Spain ought to be considered
as hostile. Sir Francis Dashwood said he
would agree to the motion, if he saw either utility or
meaning in it, but such as he would not express.
Parliament, he owned, had a right to all papers, yet
Parliament had a right too to consider if there were
any use in asking for them. He saw a proper answer
had been made to the memorial, and the Spanish
minister had been desired to recant—(Mr. Pitt cried
out, “Where?”) Spain said to France, you are making
peace, try if you cannot obtain something for me. He
had heard, he said, of no faction in the administration:
he hoped there was none any where else. Why should
not confidence be placed in the King and administration,
till it was abused? There might be something
in the papers which Spain would not like the City of
London should know—yet he supposed there was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
more than appeared. Was it wished to address the
Crown to declare war? But that was the prerogative
of the Crown. Spain, too, would probably think twice
before she embarked in hostilities. There might be
different opinions in the council of Spain. That secret
we were bound in honour to keep.</p>

<p>Lord Frederick Campbell<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> said, he did not believe
there were any factions in the ministry; if there were,
the King would put an end to them: but if the
administration were distracted, this measure would
distract them much more. He had great hopes that
these ill appearances would end in peace. Nugent<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>
lamented there being any divisions, as unanimity was
never more necessary. Bamber Gascoyne said, if any
of the papers were of too secret a nature, a secret committee
might be appointed to examine them. <em>By
destroying parties, we had created factions.</em><a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> He himself
had never been in a minister’s house, nor ever intended
it.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> The conduct of this <em>patriot</em> will appear
hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
Sir John Glynn said, that that time twenty years
had been famous for calling for papers; with intention
then to condemn a minister; now it was with a view
to applauding one. A paper had been produced at
that time which the King of Prussia never forgave.
Himself had never seen any benefit arise from motions
of that sort. Rigby said, he should be sorry if
that motion were likely to be complied with; but
that did not seem very probable. But what? had the
City instructed its representatives to demand a First
Minister? He had heard the Excise adopted by a
sort of First Minister. He would tell the House
who were the Administration; the two Secretaries of
State, the Chancellor, the President, &amp;c., and in their
deliberations there had been twelve against two; proof
enough of union. The other House had a right to
judge as well as the Commons; and was the natural
barrier between the Crown and people. Whoever
sought the Administration, might find them in the
Duke of Cumberland’s late lodgings at St. James’s
(where the councils were held). At a time when not
a man whispered to his friend, but in commendation
of the King, would the House wish to set a First
Minister over him?</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt expressed much concern at the flame that
had arisen, and that the House, by losing its temper,
had lost its reason, and degenerated into barbarism.
His friend Beckford, he feared had thought more of
him than he had done of himself; but the word <em>guide</em>,
commented as it had been, had misled him. If the
present question tended to make one individual minister,
he should be against it; but when he looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the complexion of the House, he had no such apprehension.
Censured as he had been for using an expression
so much condemned, he could not find reason
to retract it. Lord Egremont, he believed, would not
hold the Seals an hour, if not permitted to guide his
own correspondence. Thus, he himself, who he hoped
had not lessened his country, had insisted on the same
right. In the Treasury, in the Military, in the Navy,
he had never assumed or claimed any direction: had
never spoken to the King on those heads, but had
always applied to the ministers of those several departments;
had transmitted everything through the
channels of each office. He hoped, he said, to have
these egotisms pardoned; he would now come to the
question in agitation with a temper that nothing could
ruffle. Even the virtues of the King, on which the
House had been so much advised to rely, must be a
little the fruit of time; hoped his Majesty would be
aided by wholesome and deep-sighted advice. From
the present motion what mischief could arise? he
wished some necessity had made him absent—but
would it be decorous in him to be shy? in a House
where, he believed, he did not stand too well? He
believed the <em>bottom of the bottom</em> of this affair would be
dangerous; not so, while confined to memorials. Spain
had made three demands in a most extensive manner;
the right of fishery, which he had said he would
as soon give up the Tower of London, as grant; nor
would the King, he was sure, accord it; himself had
never been ordered to hold any other language. But
why, might it be said, call for these papers? because,
if you temporized, or let Spain think you temporized,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
she would more assuredly push her claims. Suspense
might be wholesome, if they were prepared, and you
were not. The contrary being true, contrary measures
should be pursued. Himself would not press
the motion, if told by authority that it was premature;
but then let the ministers say so, and mark the
era, without moulting a feather of England’s crest.
The note in the memorial, said to be delivered, was no
departure from their demands. Did they even say
they would not impede the peace on the consideration
of these demands? Let ministers declare this, and
he would second to withdraw the motion—but he saw,
he said, he should not be told so. Or had France
given up her insulting menace, that she would stand
by the demands of Spain? This was the Gordian
knot, that he himself had not been able to cut; had
feared it would rise in judgment against him; hoped
it would not against any other man. Divisions had
always existed; when were twelve men cast in the
same mould? Divisions were sometimes salutary.
Queen Elizabeth had promoted them in her Councils.
When he left administration, had never seen such
unanimity; he had said in high place, that his consolation
was, to leave such men in power; and had
declared that he would only oppose what he would
have opposed with the Seals in his hand—but to have
stayed and have done that, would only have been prejudicial.
It was the extent of Spain’s claims that had
shocked him, not her lofty idioms, the most insignificant
of all things. Whoever should cede to them but
a cockboat, ceded all. But the very present debate
would strengthen the King’s hands. He then made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
an encomium on the diligence, activity, and punctuality
of the Earl of Bristol. Should the fisheries
not be settled, the man who should give them up
would one day or other be impeached. For himself
he wished he had not been so much in the right;
<em>wished he had not known so much as he did</em>. What he
did know was buried in the centre of the earth.
France had told us with good faith, that if we did
not make up with Spain, they would break off the
Treaty with us. If Spain declared war, he should
think her <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">felo de se</i>. It would not be equal imprudence
in her to abet France. Could the House proportion
its supplies without knowing in what predicament
Spain stood with France? Should the former
declare war, she could lend money to the latter. The
revenues of Spain were under five millions, and she
employed seventy thousand men to collect them, besides
twenty thousand that were engaged in the affair
of tobacco. Was this a formidable enemy? To him
it was indifferent to derive justification from this situation
of things; should he prove to have been in the
wrong, he should comfort himself with having thought
he was right. All foreign Courts, especially Spain, would
think the present motion wise. Were he not limited, or
self-limited, he could enforce his arguments with more
strength. The Gazette had been printed to persuade
eight millions of people that Spain was amicable; but
if there were indisputable proofs to the contrary, it was
deceiving all the world. It was of no consequence to
establish on which side lay truth; Bussy’s memorial
had proved the connection between the two houses of
Bourbon. Should the event end in a rupture, we had
lost our opportunity—if affairs were in accommodation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
would the honour of England be preserved?
Would Spain be obliged to England who bowed, or to
France, who should extort from us, in the height of
our conquests, advantages for Spain?</p>

<p>Colonel Barré, whether (as he gave out afterwards)
to show that he had not taken advantage of Mr. Pitt’s
absence to abuse him the day before, or whether (as is
more probable) to pursue the point to which he had
been instigated, rose, and renewed the attack with
redoubled acrimony. Insult of language, terms, manner,
were addressed, and personally addressed, to Mr.
Pitt, by that bravo. His variations, inconsistencies,
arts, popularity, ambition, were all pressed upon Pitt
with energy and bitterness, and the whole apostrophe
wore the air of an affront more than of a philippic. He
told the House he could not amuse, but he would not
deceive them. That the disagreeable posture of our
affairs with Spain was solely owing to the late resignation,
which had thrown our councils and the nation
itself into distraction. That Mr. Pitt, though professing
it, had no confidence in the King himself. Here
Pitt, who had remained in astonishment at so bold and
novel an attack from a new speaker, called him to
order, declaring that no word guilty of so foul a crime
as want of confidence in the King had fallen from
him, and sat down, leaving Barré to proceed in his invective;
but the latter was interrupted by Fox, who
said the King’s name was never to be mentioned in a
debate; that the House had listened with pleasure
while justice was done to his Majesty’s virtues; that
Colonel Barré had a right to show to what he thought
Mr. Pitt’s arguments had tended; and that he chose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
to give the former this hint, because he seemed so able
and willing to make use of his right. Charles Yorke
said the King’s name could not be used to influence
debate. Pitt said he had referred to the King’s speech,
because it asked advice of the House. Fox, still fearing
lest the interruption and ignorance of the forms of
the House should disconcert Barré, replied, that the
speech might be quoted, because it is always understood
as the speech of the minister. Barré went on,
saying, that if any man opposed, and not from the
truest reasons, he would wish him to be silent. Should
there be a man whose whole life had been a contradiction
and a series of popular arts, he would judge
him from his actions, not from his words. Beckford
called to have the question read, to prevent such
deviation into personality. Rigby insisted that Beckford
always deviated more than Barré had done. Barré
added, that he had less reason to deviate than Beckford,
not allowing himself to be so distracted; and that
his front was not broad enough to write contradiction
on; nor would he desert the King’s service when most
wanted.</p>

<p>Pitt made no manner of reply; only turning to
Beckford, and asking pretty loud, “how far the scalping
Indians cast their tomahawks?” It seemed to
some a want of spirit, but it was evident by the indignation
of the House, that such savage war was
detested: and Pitt perhaps did not care to put them
in mind how far himself had often pushed invective;
nor chose to risk their preferring the new master of
abuse to the old. It had not been unwise, it should
seem, to have uttered a few words, stating to Barré<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
the indecence of treating an infirm and much older
man with such licence, showing him that insult could
not be resented when offered in a public assembly, who
always interpose, and putting both him and the audience
in mind, that a man, who had gained the hearts
of his countrymen by his services, could only forfeit
them by his own conduct, and not by the railing of a
private individual. With the public this outrage did
Mr. Pitt no injury. Barré was abhorred as a barbarian
irregular, and Fox, who had lent such kind assistance
to a ruffian, drew the chief odium on himself. Charles
Townshend, being asked soon after, when the House
would rise for the holidays, replied,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> “I do not know;
but when it does, the roads will be as dangerous as if
the army were disbanded.” And Barré having said that
he would not answer for his head, but would for his
heart, “Yes,” said George Selwyn,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> “if he could not,
the former would have been broken long ago.”</p>

<p>The debate was terminated by Lord George Sackville
and Elliot; the latter pleading against producing
papers in the height of a negotiation; and adding,
“perhaps an express is now on the road from Spain
determined for war.” The motion was rejected without
a division, scarcely six voices being given for the
question. Not one Tory spoke in the debate but Sir
John Glynn, and he declared against Pitt. The next
time Barré went to Court, the King took most gracious
notice of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
The City of Dublin addressed Mr. Pitt on his resignation.
The same was proposed at Lynn, and rejected;
and at Leicester such a motion was stopped
by a person producing and reading a libel called <cite>Mr.
Pitt’s Letter versified</cite>. It was done by Francis,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> a
clergyman attached to Lord Holland, who supplied
the notes. Another, by the same hand, called <cite>A Letter
from the anonymous Author of the Letters versified</cite>, was
published, reviling Mr. Pitt on bearing Barré’s ill-usage.
Lord Melcomb, at Lord Bute’s table, constantly
held the same language.</p>

<p>These specks were soon effaced in the confusion
that fell on the ministers themselves, and by the justification,
which, in spite of them, burst forth of Mr.
Pitt’s measures. The war which they had so poorly
attempted to ward off, broke upon them, when they
had no longer his assistance. A courier arrived on the
24th from Spain, with a refusal of showing us their
treaty with France. This treaty was the famous <cite>Family
Compact</cite>, to which even the House of Austria had acceded,
of which Mr. Pitt, by a masterpiece of intelligence,
had got notice,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> and of which our dastardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
ministers had hoped to deprecate the effects by pusillanimous
palliatives and submission: a compact formed
because we were become so formidable, and the very
signature of which had terrified Lord Bute and his
associates into departing at once from our superiority.
This was the secret at which Mr. Pitt had so often
hinted, and which he had now the satisfaction of hearing
published by the mouths of his enemies. We had
avoided the interception of the Spanish fleet, as Mr.
Pitt had earnestly recommended. It was now arrived,
and they temporized no longer. Fuentes was recalled,
and Lord Bristol was consequently forced to return.
Previous to his departure Fuentes delivered a memorial
to the foreign ministers, in which Mr. Pitt was
arraigned by name; an honour almost unheard of.
Alberoni had been accused by George the First; but
though that precedent was not flattering, Mr. Pitt
could want no vindication, when the Court of Spain,
and Barré, the tool of Lord Bute, conspired to charge
him with being author of the war.</p>

<p><em>We</em> had been the <em>willing</em> dupes of the Spanish House
of Bourbon. It was a more horrid insult on all good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
faith—on humanity—on ties of blood, that Spain summoned
Portugal to declare against us. The ruins of
Lisbon were almost smoking yet! The Queen of
Portugal was the Spanish Monarch’s sister; her husband
and children were dwelling in tents at a distance
from their late capital. Assassination and conspiracies
had beset the Throne. This was the moment that
Charles the Third selected to invade their kingdom!
France, it was said, in vain dissuaded this perfidy—not
from delicacy; but the meditated conquest of Portugal
was likely to engross the whole attention of the Court
of Madrid. If we should support Portugal, it might
be a division of our forces; but France needed all the
assistance Spain could lend. Timber was wholly exhausted
in France. She had sent even to Dalmatia,
and to little purpose. The expense of ship-building is
far greater in France than in England. Her cities
and trading companies set themselves to building ships
and presenting them to the King, but this was a distant
and slow resource.</p>

<p>The Queen, who bore great affection to her brothers,
was desirous that the second, Prince Charles of Mecklenburgh,
should come over. The King would not
venture to propose it to Lord Bute, but wrote to him,
and after a reluctance of a fortnight on the part of the
Favourite, the boon was granted.</p>

<p>The ministers were solicitous to remove Pratt<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
the House of Commons, and offered him the dignity
of Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. He demurred;
but was forced to accept it, for they would not only
have removed him from being Attorney-General, a
post that required a more pliant officer, and which he
was willing to give up; but they had the injustice to
refuse him his gown as King’s counsel, and he must
have pleaded below the bar, or have quitted his profession.
Mr. Yorke was made Attorney, and Norton,
Solicitor Generals. This enforced destination of Pratt
to be Chief Justice, preserved the Constitution afterwards
from the same men, whose policy exerted such
rigour against him. Mr. Yorke had lost the precedence
over Pratt when the latter was made Attorney-General.
It was on the coalition of Mr. Pitt, after
the affair of Minorca, with the Duke of Newcastle
and Lord Hardwicke. Pitt then offered to restore
Lord Anson to the lead at the Admiralty, or to make
Yorke Attorney, but would not grant both. Lord
Hardwicke preferred his son-in-law to his son; a partiality
which the latter, whose eye was fixed on the
Great Seal, and which, by these means, Pratt afterwards
obtained to his prejudice, never forgave to his
father.</p>

<p>On the first day of the year Fuentes, the Spanish
ambassador, quitted England, and was received at
Calais, and all the way to Paris, with distinguished
honours, as the saviour of France. He was a dull cold
man, and wedded to all the weakness of his religion.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Lord Bristol,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> a very Spaniard too in formality and
pride, was recalled at the same time. His abilities
had never been esteemed, and were now much called
in question; but the publication of his negotiations
did him much honour. Though he stooped to be the
tool of Mr. Pitt, he had not disliked to receive instructions
that authorized him to be imperious. His
very parsimony gave way to any ostentation about his
own person.</p>

<p>On the second, the King, in full council, declared
his resolution of making war on Spain: for the ministers,
who had driven out Mr. Pitt, rather than embrace
this necessary measure, were reduced to adopt it at
the expense of vindicating him and condemning themselves;
and, what was worse to the nation than their
shame, had not him, nor his spirit, to conduct them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
Nor yet were they unanimous on this point, or on any
other part of the war. Lord Bute’s object was, peace
at any rate, that he might pursue his plans of power
at home. Fox aimed at the destruction of Pitt, and
at favour with and through the Favourite, to which he
sacrificed his views of wealth, as Paymaster, in the
German war. The Duke of Cumberland, who was
now rather openly, than confidentially, consulted, was
inclined to support the German war; either from partiality
to the Electorate, or hoping to command there
in the room of Prince Ferdinand. His Royal Highness
was reconciled to the Duke of Newcastle, who, to
please the Duke and Lady Yarmouth,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> fluctuated again
towards the war in Germany, though he could not lead
back his friend Lord Hardwicke<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> to that side. The
bias too had been too strongly given to the Duke of
Bedford, who declared he would move in Parliament
to recall our troops from Germany. Lord Bute, fearing
the Duke would gain too great popularity by this
conduct, and inclined enough to heap any mortifications
on the King of Prussia and the House of Brunswick,
took the same side; but was persuaded, as the
money was already voted and the contracts made, to
suffer the troops to make one more campaign there.
The Duke of Bedford was assured by the King, that
measures would be taken for recalling the troops,
without recurring to the authority of Parliament.
Yet so much did they dread the effects of Mr. Pitt’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
influence with the nation, and of their own unpopular
measures, that they agreed to give the King of Prussia
his subsidy for another year, but would not renew the
treaty with him, which now expired.</p>

<p>They were still more divided and embarrassed on
the war with Spain. Unavoidable as it was, the
Dukes of Newcastle and Bedford, Lord Hardwicke
and Lord Mansfield,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> were against engaging in it; and
Hardwicke, when the affirmative was decided, declared
he would return no more to Council. But Lord Bute,
Lord Granville,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Lord Egremont, George Grenville,
and, I think, Lord Ligonier, prevailed for the declaration
of war. Lord Anson<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> was ill, and the Duke of
Devonshire out of town.</p>

<p>Yet, though the war with Spain was a popular measure,
the City and the country had so mean an opinion
of those who were to direct it, that the stocks immediately
fell to 66½, though in the Rebellion they had
never been lower than 72. The declaration from
Spain luckily arrived three days after the first subscription
on the new loan had been paid—yet it sunk
four per cent.—three days sooner, and it would not
have been paid at all.</p>

<p>On the 4th, war was declared. The next day
came news of the reduction of Colberg, almost the
last hope of the King of Prussia. Nor yet were the
Ministers ready to decide, whether they would blow up
the fortifications of Belleisle and abandon it, or whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
they should undertake to support Portugal. They
determined first to send Lord Tyrawley<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> thither, while
Lord Albemarle<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> kissed the King’s hand for the command
of the expedition, which was so often set forth
and so often countermanded, and which at last laboured
to sea. It was to take up troops at Martinico,
and thence sail to attack the Havannah.</p>

<p>On the 19th the Parliament met, and the King
acquainted both Houses with the new war he had
undertaken; a ceremonial decorated by the Favourite
himself, who, as if he had wrenched the thunderbolt
out of Mr. Pitt’s hands only to wield it himself with
mightier vigour, now harangued the Parliament for
the first time. Every preparative of pomp, attitude,
and lofty language were called in to make him worthy
of himself. His admirers were in ecstacies; the few
that dared to sneer at his theatric fustian, did not find
it quite so ridiculous as they wished. It was enough
for the former that their god was not dumb, and there
was no danger that he would familiarize himself too
often with the multitude. He affected to adopt parliamentary
measures, and to wish that all the negotiations
with Spain might be laid before them; graciously
promising to beseech the King that not only
papers might be produced, but that the Cabinet-councillors
themselves might be permitted to divulge the
opinions they had given. This was a puny piece of
chicane, the Ministers endeavouring to prove that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
hostilities of Spain were subsequent in date to the
period in which Mr. Pitt found it advisable from their
conduct to attack the Spaniards. He had early detected
their league with France, and was not of a
humour to weigh dates against facts, or memorials
against combinations. Nor Hardwicke’s forms nor
Mansfield’s subtleties could persuade the seeing part
of mankind that a war at our doors ought to be
treated with the same literal circumspection as an
action of trespass or battery at common law.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt himself, in the House of Commons, with
much seeming modesty, assumed the honour that was
due to his intelligence and foresight; and by disclaiming
any triumph on the necessity into which the ministers
had fallen of making war, asserted the right, to
which his counsels had entitled him, of having pointed
out the moment when the war ought to have commenced—a
moment, lost by his enemies, without the
benefit of having warded off the war with Spain.
Lord North,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> who seconded the address of thanks for
the King’s speech, had injudiciously furnished Pitt
with an opportunity of vindicating his measures, calling
him an abdicated minister, and violently taxing
him with a fondness for new hostilities. Nothing
could be more cool or artful than Pitt’s reply. It was
all panegyric; all gratitude for his Majesty’s resentment
of Spain’s provoking conduct, and for the <em>caution</em>
with which he promised to engage in so large a
war. In his own particular situation, he might be
supposed not to like such firm, and yet such <em>cautious</em>
measures—but he did; he heartily thanked the ministers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
for their <em>caution</em>; and meaned to conciliate unanimity,
which he hoped would spread from one end of
the island to the other. Himself for five years had
laboured successfully—but he did not mean to pride
himself that way—yet he had proved not to have been
so much in the wrong as his enemies had thought;
and, however Lord North had disparaged his intelligence,
activity, and discernment, he hoped his successors
would not be endowed with worse or less;
and that the people would place confidence in the
administration, whose large and wide-spread connections
must be followed by confidence and favour. A
poor individual like himself could have no such favour
and following! He should easily have been blamed,
if any slip had appeared in his conduct. <em>Now</em> it must
be the King—it must be the Administration, the Parliament,
nation, army, and navy, who were to carry on
the war; and he prayed to God it might all be enough!
Yet he thought us equal to the whole. However, he
had not sought the Spanish war; and if it were not
too much for a poor individual, <em>for an abdicated Minister</em>,
to say, he hoped it would appear, that for five
years together he had made much political court to
Spain, and great persons had concurred with him in
those counsels. The sacrifices he had offered would
show how much he and they had been in the right;
and that he had not been so haughty as was represented
in rejecting Bussy’s memorial. He would never
call for the papers which would exemplify the temper
he had used towards Spain. If his Majesty should
think they would satisfy the nation, would satisfy
Europe, he knew he should appear to have had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
unanimous approbation of the whole Cabinet to several
of the papers he had sent to Spain. But what imported
it what one man or another had thought three
months before? Since that era he had received such
public marks of Royal approbation, together with a
pension and peerage (for his wife), as few individuals
could boast. The moment was come when every man
ought to <em>show himself</em> for the whole. I do, said he,
cruelly as I have been treated in pamphlets and libels.
Arm the whole! Be one people! This war, though
it has cut deep into our pecuniary, had augmented our
military faculties. Set that against the debt, that
spirit which has made us what we are. Forget everything
but the public!—for the public I forget both my
wrongs and my infirmities.</p>

<p>Grenville told him he would have his wish: orders
were given for laying before the House all the papers
from the time of Bussy’s memorial. “I have no wish
for their coming,” replied Pitt, “If for the benefit of
his Majesty’s affairs, let them come; and if they do
come, shall it be with no farther retrospect than
Bussy’s memorial? How condescending is the boon!
how futile! how unsatisfactory!”</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding their affected alacrity for war
on this occasion, the new Ministers took every opportunity
of raising disgust in the nation against the late
measures. Rigby, at the instigation of Fox, moved
that Colonel Boyd should lay before the House of
Commons the muster-roll of the Hessians, on whom he
threw out many reflections, and affirmed that 9000
men were wanting out of the 22,000 which they
ought to furnish. He said the muster-rolls of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
mercenaries were not returned to the office of the
Secretary at War; and complained that not a single
order was gone to recruit the army in Germany, which
ought to amount to 96,000 men. He hoped Prince
Ferdinand would be allowed to give no more orders to
British troops. He pretended to approve the declaration
against Spain, but then endeavoured to show
that we were unequal to a new war. It required, he
said, 38,000 men to garrison our conquests; and yet
those garrisons fell short by 11,000 men. Belleisle
alone had cost near half a million; yet what did it
furnish but sprats and little cows? Canada gave us
only furs; yet hats were not become cheaper; nor
were sugar or rum fallen by the acquisition of <em>opulent</em>
Guadaloupe; nor negroes by the conquest of Goree;
gum was the only commodity reduced. For Louisbourg,
he hoped the fortifications would be blown up.
The enemy was hurt, but were we enriched, except
from the successes in the East Indies? He wished, in
short, not to keep our conquests, and to put an end to
a ruinous war, in which we had no allies but mercenaries.</p>

<p>Charles Townshend took the same key, and said it
had been fortunate, if our apprehension of Spain had
driven us to make peace with France. He feared we
should sink from a dream of ambition to a state of
bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Stanley maintained that France had been in earnest
in the negotiation, but had been buoyed up by the ambition
and revenge of Spain. Was France so weak,
and yet not in earnest? The object of his own labours
had been to keep France divided from Spain, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
that view England had offered to yield more than she
had asked in return. This was a strong vindication of
Mr. Pitt’s conduct, and from a competent witness.</p>

<p>Grenville, in answer to Beckford, said, he would
pawn his life that no assurances had been given to the
City that there would be no Spanish war. Thomas
Walpole<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> replied, that he had never been told from
the Treasury that there would not be war with Spain;
yet he would say, that had the City apprehended it,
they would not have lent their money so easily. The
Hessian papers were ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<p>In prosecution of the same hostilities to Pitt, the
Duke of Bedford, resisting the most earnest entreaties
of the Duke of Cumberland, and even without the
approbation of the Court, determined to make his motion,
which, however, he softened from a proposal of
recalling the troops from Germany, into a resolution of
the ruinous impracticability of carrying on the war.
He might as decently have termed it an exhortation to
Spain not to dread our arms. Lord Bute, to show the
Court did not countenance so gross a measure, moved
the previous question, and was supported by Newcastle,
Melcomb, and Denbigh. Lord Temple of course opposed
the Duke of Bedford. The Lords Shelburne,
Pomfret, and Talbot spoke for the motion; but the
previous question was carried by 105 to 16, which latter
were the friends of Bedford and Fox. Six or seven
even protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
In the course of the debate Lord Bute dropped
hints of important good news, which he had received
that very morning. It was supposed to mean the
pacific disposition of the new Czar. Elizabeth, his
aunt, was just dead, and Peter the Third had mounted
the Russian throne. So far from inheriting her animosity
to the King of Prussia, the young Emperor was
his enthusiastic admirer, and more likely to war under
his banners than to continue to overwhelm him with
torrents of barbarians.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford receiving such a rebuff from
the Lords, the faction dropped the design of renewing
the motion in the Commons, the consequence having
been a side-wind of approbation to Mr. Pitt, and almost
applause to Lord Bute for taking up the military
spirit—an approbation the latter did not wish to receive,
nor intend to merit. However, 5000 men were
ordered for Portugal, and the command destined to
Lord Tyrawley. Lord Albemarle too, and his brothers,
Commodore and Colonel Keppel,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> set out for Portsmouth
on the expedition to the Havannah; but they
did not sail till the beginning of March. Lord
Tyrawley went to Lisbon at the same time, whither
M. Dunn, or Odunn, who had married a daughter of
Parsons,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> a famous Jacobite alderman in the last reign,
was dispatched from Versailles to traverse his negotiations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Dr. Osbaldiston,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> the aged Bishop of Carlisle, was
translated to the See of London, on the death of
Bishop Hayter; and was succeeded by Lyttelton,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Dean
of Exeter.</p>

<p>In France, Marshal Broglio, and his brother, the
Count, were disgraced by Court intrigues. They were
the best, and almost only successful officers in the
French service. The marshal<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> was a mere disciplinarian,
of no parts. The Count<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> was lively, and earnest
to inform himself; and by being quicker than his brother,
with not much better parts, was only more likely
to be in the wrong: but they were both men of strict
honour. Having presented a memorial against the
Prince of Soubize, in which they attacked Stainville,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
brother of the Duke of Choiseul, the latter, who possessed
the favour of Madame de Pompadour, procured
the marshal and his brother to be banished to their
country-seats.</p>

<p>The Tories, triumphing in the partiality of the Court,
and rather offended than alarmed at the jealousy with
which they were beheld by the Whigs, who in power,
property, and credit were beyond comparison the preponderating
part of the nation, took every occasion of
displaying their old prejudices and resentments. On
every contested election they acted in a body against
the old Whigs, or later converts, however attached to
the Court. Thus they exerted all their interest against
Lord Gower<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> and Lord Orford<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> on election-causes, and
against the Duke of Bridgwater<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> and Lord Strange,
on a bill for a new northern navigation—points, on
every one of which the Tories were rancorous and unsuccessful.
Nor was Scotland wiser. One Haldane
had stood for Bridport, lost it, and petitioned. Sir
Henry Erskine, a creature of the Favourite, had the
indecency and folly to call the English party in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
House of Commons <em>a profligate majority</em>; an offence
not forgotten, though the Scots were beaten by three
to one. The inconsiderable number that in either
House of Parliament adhered to Mr. Pitt, and the
almost universal acquiescence to the Favourite’s influence,
persuaded both him and his dependents, that
they had but to give the tone, and prerogative would
master all opposition. Nor did his partisans do more
than was practised by the Favourite himself. If they
insulted the nation, he ruled the Court with a rod of
iron. The Queen, her brother, and the brothers of the
King, were taught to feel their total want of credit.
The Duke of York, as Lord Anson was dying, ambitioned
the post of Lord High Admiral, but did not
dare even to ask it. Prince William,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> the favourite
brother of the King, wished also to be employed
abroad, and ordered Legrand,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> his governor, to solicit
Lord Bute for a command. The haughty Earl treated
Legrand with scurrilous language for putting such
things into the Prince’s head. The Duke of York,
who, though the elder, was by far the more indiscreet
of the brothers, openly expressed his resentment and
contempt of Lord Bute and the Scotch; and as a
mark of disobedience, went to a hunting party at the
Duke of Richmond’s, to which he had been invited
with the Prince of Mecklenburg; but the latter was
not suffered to go to a disaffected house in disaffected
company.</p>

<p>But while inactivity reigned in the Parliament of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
England, that of Ireland was not idle. Lord Halifax,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>
their new Lord-Lieutenant, was, like most of his predecessors
very popular at first. They voted him an
additional salary of four thousand pounds a year. He
had the decency, though very necessitous, not to accept
it for himself, but desired it might be settled
on his successors. The House of Commons, however,
would not wait till it should take place, to pay themselves,
but passed a vote to make their Parliaments,
which existed during the life of each King, septennial.
The party attached to the Castle<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> voted for it, concluding
it would be thrown out by the Lords. The
Lords, as provident for their popularity, thinking it
would be rejected in England, passed it likewise. It
was rejected here, but not without much disposition in
some of the Council to have it granted. Lord Hilsborough,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>
who had great weight with Lord Halifax,
stayed with him in Dublin, and openly made war on
the Primate;<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> while William Gerard Hamilton,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Secretary, gained such applause in that Parliament,
that a motion for augmenting the troops was carried
by the sole power of his eloquence.</p>

<p>March 19th, the bill for continuing the militia for
seven years was passed by the House of Commons in
England; and the counties, that had not raised theirs,
were ordered to pay five pounds a man. This was
settled by a compromise, lest a longer term should be
insisted on. Its own friends were sick of it, and had
clogged it with many clauses, in hopes it would be rejected
by their opponents. But the Ministers would
not risk the unpopularity of a negative, and were even
afraid to part with so large a body of men.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of March arrived news of the conquest
of Martinico by General Monckton<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> and Admiral
Rodney:<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> a plan ascribed by the people to Mr. Pitt,
though executed under the auspices of the Favourite.
In truth, the valour of the nation had taken such a
bent, that Lord Bute could not check it: nothing but
a peace could chain it up. If the Earl did favour
any part of the war, it was that in Portugal. Colonel
Burgoyne<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> was ordered thither with five thousand foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
and six hundred horse; and there was a plan for
regimenting twenty-five thousand papists in Ireland
for the same service; but the Irish Government did
not approve of giving discipline and arms to such
dangerous inmates. For General-in-Chief, it was proposed
to send to Lisbon the Prince of Bevern. He
had been suspected of infidelity by the King of
Prussia,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a>—had been disgraced, and his intellects were
not reckoned sound. Lord Tyrawley sent home his
aides-de-camp, affecting to wonder that we expected
any invasion of Portugal. This was imputed to his
disgust at not obtaining the command himself; he who
was a brave and old general, and who was perfectly
acquainted with the country.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> The Prince of Bevern
declined the offer; and Count la Lippe accepted it.
He was born in England, had distinguished himself in
every hussar-kind of service, and in his dress and
manners copied Charles XII. of Sweden, though with
more politeness. He found the Portuguese troops in
the most deplorable state of cowardice and want of
discipline. The English could not, and did not disguise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
their contempt of them. The Spanish army
might have marched to Lisbon, had they met with no
obstruction but from the natives. The English troops
saved that country; and Count La Lippe, before he
left Portugal, formed a regular army there.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>The facility which the Favourite found of mastering
so great and victorious a kingdom, and of removing
the man who had carried the glory of his country so
high, was not the only evidence, that however enlightened
an age may be, knavery and folly need
never despair. The tares they sow will shoot amidst
any harvest. Will it be credited that, while the Romish
superstition was crumbling away even in Spain
and Portugal, a set of enthusiastic rogues dared to
exhibit in the very heart of London, a pantomime of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
imposture, which would hardly have been swallowed
in a paltry village of Castile? The methodists had
endeavoured to establish in Warwickshire, not only
the belief, but the actual existence of ghosts. Being
detected, they struck a bold stroke, and attempted to
erect their system in the metropolis itself. A methodist
family, at first out of revenge, endeavoured to
fasten on one Parsons the imputation of having debauched
and murdered his wife’s sister. A young
girl was reported to be visited by the deceased, whom
she called Fanny, and with whom she established a
correspondence of question and answer—not by words,
but by scratching. A certain number of scratches signified
“yes;” another number, “no.” At first this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
farce, which was acted in Cock-lane, in the city, was
confined to the mob of the neighbourhood. As the
rumour spread, persons of all ranks thronged to the
house. Two methodist clergymen constantly attended
the child, who lay in bed in a wretched chamber, with
only a dim rushlight at one end. These worthy divines
affected to cast an air of most serious import
on the whole transaction, and by their interposition
prompted Fanny and the girl on any dilemma. A
servant wench commented and explained Fanny’s
oracle. The father would accept no money from the
various visitants, for which he was promised an adequate
recompense by the chiefs of the sect. When
the story had gained a requisite footing, Fanny had
the indiscreet confidence to declare that her body was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
not in the vault where it had been interred. Samuel
Johnson, author of the Dictionary, was in the number
of the deluded, and with some others as wise as himself,
visited the vault, where, to the disappointment of
their credulity, they found the body.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> Had the precaution
been taken of conveying it away, the fury
of the people might have been actuated to strange
lengths; for so much credit had the story gained,
that Parsons, the accused, fearing a prosecution, began
first. A regular trial<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> instantly unravelled the cheat:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
the girl was detected of performing the scratchings
herself, and one of the clergymen proved to be her
abettor. Lord Chief Justice Mansfield tried the cause:
the divine had the impudence to present a letter
to him on the bench from the Archbishop of Canterbury,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>
interceding on his behalf, for Secker had
a fellow feeling for hypocritical enthusiasm. The
Chief Justice put the letter into his pocket unopened,
saying it was impossible it could relate to the cause in
question. Yet the punishment of these impostors was
very moderate: whereas the same judge inflicted most
severe penalties on one Anett, who published weekly
papers against the book of Genesis. The methodists
did not take shame. They turned informers against
profaners of the Sabbath, tried to establish great
rigour on Good Friday and the fast-days, and to revive
the superstition of holidays, when even the late
Pope himself, Benedict XIV.,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> had struck several out
of the calendar. But the ritual of the Church of
Rome was too rich in materials not to be copied by
new zealots. They introduced into their service
hymns sung in parts by children, as very captivating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
to the multitude; and the Countess of Huntingdon,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
the patroness of the rising Church, erected a chapel at
Bath, and at other places of drinking waters, the sick
and diseased being an obvious prey to Reformers.
Hogarth exerted his last stroke of genius on the occasion
above mentioned: the print he published on
the Cock-lane Ghost had a mixture of humorous and
sublime satire, that not only surpassed all his other
performances, but which would alone immortalize his
unequalled talents.</p>

<p>The expectations conceived of the new Czar were
now verified. He declared to the Empress Queen,
to France, and to Sweden, that he was ready to
abandon his conquests for peace, and hoped they were
in the same disposition—not at the same price.
France, indeed, had many losses to regain, few acquisitions
to restore—but her hopes were placed on
Spain. Sweden had made no conquests, and must
obey the dictates of so powerful a mediator; but the
Empress Queen was far from being equally tractable.
Peter, however, having sacrificed the first moments to
decency, gave the next to the gratification of his will;
and without stipulating for his allies, whose politics
and procrastination were incompatible with his ardour,
he not only made peace with his favourite monarch,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>
but promised the same troops, which under the late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Czarina had almost crushed him. Nor was this a
bare promise, but faithfully executed. Such admiration
of a hero was not likely to content itself with
merely becoming his ally. Few men idolize heroism
but they who feel the passion in their own breasts.
Having obliged Sweden to make peace too, the young
Czar turned his eye towards military exploits in a
new field, and determined to attempt the conquest of
the duchy of Sleswick from Denmark. Yet if he was
dazzled by the martial talents of the King of Prussia,
Peter had a heart susceptible of the most extensive
humanity. One of his first acts on his accession was
to bestow liberty on the Russian nobility. For the
poor he lessened the tax on salt, and for the relief of
all, abolished the Inquisition of the State. All the
exiles were recalled, or received great mitigation of
their punishments. There was one man to whom the
Czar, though not so bountiful as he ought to have
been, was very kind. This was Count Schouvalow, the
favourite and supposed husband of the late Czarina.
A man, who in twelve years of absolute power had
never made an enemy; and who, had he ambitioned
a crown as much as he deserved one, might have
reigned. This upright man told the Czar that he had
in his possession a very large sum of money, which he
believed the Empress, his late mistress, had intended
he should take for his own use, but not having been a
specific gift, he thought it his duty to surrender it to
his Majesty. The Emperor said he was in great want
of money, took it, but ordered him to choose two
thousand pounds a year in land wherever he pleased.
I knew this amiable person afterwards, wandering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
about Europe,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> possessed of nothing beyond that revenue,
and sighing after a country to which it had been
imprudent to return.</p>

<p>The Czar and the King of Prussia wished to engage
us in the war with Denmark; but though the Council
was divided on the measure, Denmark was too intimately
connected with us, and as a maritime power,
was too near a neighbour to Scotland. In this exigence
the King of Denmark marched with a considerable
force to Hamburgh, and obliged that opulent city
to furnish him with a million of rix-dollars.</p>

<p>In Ireland seemed approaching a scene of a new
kind. The jealousy of commerce had ever swayed
England to keep that kingdom in a state of humiliation
and restraint; consequently of poverty. The
lowest class of people in no country less enjoyed the
sweets of being; and in no country sought less to
emerge from their state of barbarism. Proud and
slothful, they created a kind of dignity to themselves
from inactivity. To labour no more than noblemen,
was a sort of nobility; and ignorance of a happier
fate was happiness. They preserved their ancient
poetry and traditional genealogies; hated the English
settled amongst them as invaders, and necessarily were
bigoted to their old superstitions in opposition to the
religion of their masters. In short, they wanted but
luxury, to have all the passions and prejudices of great
lords. A considerable part of the island was plunged
in this dismal darkness and misery. As a spirit of
opposition and independence had spread amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Protestant inhabitants, a spirit of improvement had
gone forth too. Manufactures were established, roads
and bridges made, and rivers rendered navigable. Inclosures
for cultivation of lands had followed. Occupation
of commons seemed usurpation to a race of lazy
savages; and the first murmurs were carefully blown
up to rage by their priests. A massacre had been the
last instance in which the Catholics of Ireland had
had any superiority; and Popish priests are historians
enough to be ignorant of no such era. It was the
cause of property to throw down inclosures; of heaven,
to cut the throats of inclosers—and of France and
Spain, to promote the good work. The tumults, however,
began upon the single foot of their grievances.
Great insurrections appeared in Waterford, the chief
improvements having been made upon the Burlington
estate. The rabble soon distinguished itself by the
name of <em>White Boys</em>; and their instructors, to veil
one nonsense under a greater, taught them to give out
that they were subject to the Queen of the Fairies,
whom they called <em>Sieve Oltugh</em>, in whose name their
manifestoes were signed. It appeared afterwards on
the trials of some of their chiefs, that this fairy
sovereign resided at Versailles. French officers were
discovered among them; and during the Duke of
Bedford’s regency, a rising had actually been made
in the same quarter just as Thurot landed. After
many outrages, they proceeded to cruelty, and buried
three persons up to their chins, who had declared they
knew the ringleaders. As their numbers and impunity
increased, so did their insolence. They obliged the
town of Lismore to hang out lights, and forced a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
justice of peace to fix up a proclamation by which
they regulated the price of provisions, and forbad any
cheese to be made till after Lent, that the poor might
have the milk—a proof that the devotees of the Queen
of the Fairies, and of the Virgin Mary, were equally
attached to the observation of the Fast.</p>

<p>For six weeks this insurrection was neglected; and
two regiments of dragoons, that were sent against
them, proved unequal to the work. At last the House
of Commons took up the affair, and foot being ordered
out against the seditious, the matter was quashed,
though not entirely suppressed, till the Earl of Hertford<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>
was Lord Lieutenant, who refusing to pardon
some of the chiefs, notwithstanding very considerable
intercession, an end was put to the affair—but unless
that country is more civilized and reclaimed from barbarism,
or better guarded before another war breaks
out, it will probably be selected by France and Spain
for the first scene of their operations. At the time
of which I have been speaking, France was more
earnest to make a general peace, than to incense us by
opening a war within our very gates,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> and which might
have made it dangerous for the Favourite to second
their views.</p>

<p>He was hotly pushing his schemes to projection;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
and resolved not only to make the peace, but to be indisputably
first minister when it should be made. Mr.
Pitt was removed, who could have obstructed the first
object; but while the Duke of Newcastle held the
Treasury, there was a division of power, which all the
lustre of favour could not entirely surmount. They
who looked forward, bowed to the idol; but they who
held by gratifications to the Treasury, could not but
kiss the hand that dealt the bribe. At first it was
designed by disgusts to drive the Duke to resign.
Elliot and Oswald<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> were instructed to treat him rudely
at his own board: but an old minister or an old mistress
endure many shocks before they can be shaken
off:<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> nor could all his own treacheries persuade the
Duke of Newcastle that Lord Bute could so soon
forget how instrumental his Grace had been in undermining
Mr. Pitt. He still had a mind to be of the
plot, though himself was become the object of it.</p>

<p>Newcastle’s friends were quicker sighted; and foreseeing
that they must again range under Mr. Pitt, if
cast off by the Court, they began to have doubts and
difficulties—and did but hasten their fall, by daring to
resume a right of opinion. The expense of the Portuguese
war administered their first pretence of complaint,
and the protection given to the King of Prussia
by the Czar, changed the posture of his affairs so advantageously,
that it had no gross appearance, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
the Dukes of Cumberland, Newcastle, Devonshire, and
their faction grew earnest for the continuance of the
war in Germany. The Duke of Bedford, who was
more than half-gained to the Court, but who always
added some contradiction of his own, was averse to
both wars, Portuguese and German; and Fox, who
was willing to preserve an interest in the Duke of
Cumberland, had a difficult part to act. He said to
me, “The Duke of Devonshire says it is a Tory measure
to abandon the Continent; for my part I do not
know who are Whigs; they bore the partiality of the
Pelhams<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> to the Tories, and Mr. Pitt’s declaration in
their favour, who had complained that they enjoyed
none of the favours of Government.” Lord Mansfield
would have preserved Newcastle to the Court, but
Lord Hardwicke pulled the other way. Lord Lincoln<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>
was devoted to Pitt, and wished to unite him and his
uncle Newcastle. The Duke of Devonshire advised
the latter to resign; but so great was his inclination to
keep even the dregs of power with the dregs of life,
and so great his fear of being called to account for the
waste of money on the German war, that though the
King, as a fresh affront, declared seven new peers,
without acquainting him, he not only overlooked it,
but begged his cousin, Mr. Pelham,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> might be added to
the number, and got the barony of Pelham bestowed
on himself, with reversion to that relation.</p>

<p>I am forced to detail these intrigues, because the
moment was critical, and because it gave birth to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
new party, and to many subsequent events. The
Court was the more stiff, because they had conveyed a
message through Count Virri,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> the Sardinian minister
in England, to the Bailli de Solar,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> the Sardinian
minister at Paris, desiring to renew the negotiation
where it had been broken off. Lord Bute had gone
farther: he had ordered Sir Joseph Yorke to treat
privately with the Court of Vienna, without the knowledge
of the King of Prussia. For some time the
Court of Vienna did not vouchsafe an answer. To the
confusion of the Favourite, the first news he had of any
answer to come, was from the Baron de Knyphausen,
the King of Prussia’s minister here.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>April 28th, the new peers kissed hands. Lord<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
Wentworth and Sir William Courtenay,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Tories, were
made Viscounts. Lord Egmont,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> Lord Milton,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> Lord
Brudenel, the Duke of Newcastle, Sir Edward Hussy

the two latter Tories, were made Barons, and Lady
Caroline Fox, a Baroness. Lord Ligonier’s Irish peerage
was entailed on his nephew. Mr. Vernon,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> clerk
of the Council, and Mr. Olmius,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> were created Irish
Barons. The Prince of Mecklenburg,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> brother of the
Queen, was made a Major-General. Lord Bute had
often waved her request. She was advised to apply
to the Princess, and the favour was immediately
granted. Soon after, Buckingham House<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> was purchased
and bestowed on her Majesty, St. James’s not
seeming a prison strait enough. There the King and
Queen lived in the strictest privacy, attended absolutely
by none but menial servants; and never came
to the palace but for the hours of levies and drawing-rooms.
The King’s younger brothers were kept, till
they came of age, in as rigid durance. Prince Henry,
the third, a very lively lad, being asked if he had been
confined with the epidemic cold, replied, “Confined!
that I am, without any cold;” and soon after, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
the Garter was bestowed on Prince William and Lord
Bute, Prince Henry said, “I suppose Mr. Mackenzie<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>
and I shall have the green ribands.”</p>

<p>May 12th. The House of Commons debated on a
vote of credit, and the support of Portugal. Glover
the poet pleaded against Portugal’s claim to our assistance,
from their many infractions of treaties, from
their cramping our trade, and from the impossibilities
our merchants had found of obtaining redress; a complaint
that seemed to bear hard on the late ministry:
to which he added reflections on the extravagance of
the German war, which, contrary to the professions of
ministers, had grown from £200,000 to six or seven
millions. Pitt was offended, and corrected Glover,
who threw his information on some nameless merchants,
by whom he had been told that their remonstrances
on the difficulties of the Portuguese trade
had not been read by the ministers. Wilkes censured
the weakness and irresolution of the ministry;
their abandoning Belleisle, and neglecting to send over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
the officers to Germany. It was even said, he affirmed,
that they had been humiliating themselves at the
Court of Vienna. Legge more gently, and Beckford
with more rhodomontade, pressed the same accusations.
The latter was for invading Spain by sea; declared
that the City suspected the ministry of wavering,
and demanded to have their <em>old minister</em> again.
Grenville answered finely, and compared the smallness
of the sum demanded, £300,000, with the expense in
Germany. Belleisle had cost more than what was now
asked for Portugal. That Court knew how we were
embarrassed, and asked not more than she knew we
could give. What proof was there of irresolution?
was not Martinico conquered? was not the Havannah
likely to follow? or did Beckford think that great
words, blustered in Parliament, constituted resolution?
Fluctuating reports were rather owing to stockjobbers
than to fluctuation in the measures of Government.
He affirmed that not one step had been taken at
Vienna derogatory to any of our connections. We
had only tried to feel how they relished the family-compact
among the Bourbons. But whether the resolution
was taken to recall our troops from Germany,
or at all events to go on, would it be prudent to
declare which was to be the measure?</p>

<p>Lord George Sackville was liberal in blaming the
expense of the German war, which he compared with
that of Queen Anne; <em>the whole</em> of which, he maintained,
except in 1711 and 1712, did not amount to what
this German war had cost alone, though we had then
employed more British and other troops than at present.
Queen Anne’s war had never exceeded eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
millions, including garrisons, fleet, &amp;c. The expense
of 172,000 men from 1709 to 1711 had not gone
beyond what one year had recently cost in Germany.
If there had not been new inventions for expense, we
should not now be ready to beg peace.</p>

<p>Pitt, in a very capital style, took up the cause of
Portugal: he did not stoop to that little hackneyed
practice of party, opposing whatever was the measure
of the adversary. He had stood forth for general war,
and for reduction of the House of Bourbon. To advise
still larger war was constancy to the same plan; and
it was still safer to advise it, when he was no longer
answerable for the event. To oppose vigorous steps
would have been more truly lending aid to the Court,
who wanted to get clear of the war.</p>

<p>As having been a public minister, he must not, he
said, intrench himself within his present private situation,
but speak his opinion. He should not wait for
events, but speak boldly as a counsellor. If he voted
for this measure, it was giving the Crown his advice,
as if he was called to Council. He did think we ought
to support Portugal, both for commercial and political
reasons. Portugal is in the immediate predicament of
nearness to us after Ireland and our Colonies. <em>It assists,
without draining us.</em> Assistance was a matter of
justice due from us to an oppressed, insulted ally.
There had not been such an infraction of treaties as
would release us from the ties of treaties. Should we
sit with folded arms while the two branches of Bourbon,
those proudest of the proud, would exclude us
from neutral ports? We must set Portugal on its
legs, not take it on our shoulders. He then expatiated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
on the character of Carvalho, the prime minister
of Portugal, his inflexibility to danger, his intrepidity;
and drew a picture that might almost have
passed for his own, as he seemed to mean it should.
Would there be danger in this measure? he was a co-operator
in it. If you, as a maritime power, cannot
protect Portugal, Genoa will next be shut against
you; and then the ports of Sardinia:—what! ports
shut against the first maritime power in the world!
He then turned Glover into ridicule; said he admired
his poetry, but <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quanto optimus omnium poeta, tanto</i>—he
would not, he said, go on. For the sum demanded,
it might easily be raised, or a million more: and he
would give the same opinion, whether the Duke of
Newcastle continued minister, or should be succeeded
by Mr. Fox, as was generally said to be the intention.
The only difficulty was to find funds. It had been
predicated for three years that we could not raise
more money; therefore it was plain we could. Lord
George should have put into the scale what our enemies
had lost; they had been losing, we acquiring.
He hoped we should keep up our officers and our
marine, and not decrease the latter, as we had done
after the last peace. France had last year spent eight
millions in Germany. To outlast an enemy was worth
perseverance. But we would not distinguish between
contracting our expenses and contracting our operations.
He paid great compliments to the officers of
land and sea, and pleaded earnestly against relinquishing
Germany. It would be turning loose an hundred
and forty thousand French to overrun the Low Countries
and Portugal. If there was any odium from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
German war, he begged it might fall on him; though
he had never seen a contractor, yet he would not disculpate
himself by censuring others; and he spoke in
mitigation of the blame thrown on the Treasury, owning
he thought some little might have been saved, but
not suspecting them of dishonesty. Yet, were an inquiry
moved, he would second it; he would screen
nobody. After the King of Prussia had been so ill-treated
on our account, would we throw such a power
out of our alliance, only to save three or four hundred
thousand pounds? But he thought he had heard the
army was not to be recalled—was transported to find
Lord Granby was going to it. Himself was the only
man that agreed with the whole administration, for he
approved both of war in Germany and war in Portugal;
and he was so far from meditating opposition,
that he should regard the man who would revive parties
as an enemy to his country. Himself had contributed
to annihilate <em>party</em>, but it had not been to
pave the way for <em>those who only intended to substitute one
party to another</em>.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> Should the least cloud arise between
London and Berlin, he prayed for temper and reconciliation.
He wished to move that the continuation
of the subsidy to Prussia might be added to the vote
of credit; but it did not become him to move for
more than was asked by the King’s servants: yet he
wished the vote of credit had been greater, and knew
the Duke of Newcastle wished so too. He should
rejoice to see the session closed with the grant of a
large sum of money, because England could not well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
treat but at the head of all her force. Russia had
acceded to Prussia—how much wiser to give money
to that monarch now, when he is in a better situation,
than, as you would do, if he were still more distressed!
Nay, that little teazing incident, Sweden, was removed
by dread of the Czar. Sweden is a free nation, <em>but
factions and a corrupted senate have lowered it from the
great figure it made an hundred years ago</em>. Act now,
continued he, upon a great system, while it is in your
power! A million more would be a pittance to place
you at the head of Europe, and enable you to treat
with efficacy and dignity. Save it not in this last
critical year! Give the million to the war at large,
and add three, four, or five hundred thousand pounds
more to Portugal; or avow to the House of Bourbon
that you are not able to treat at the head of your
allies.</p>

<p>This speech, so artful, elevated, so much in character,
and so distressful to the Junto that were
endeavouring to steal disgrace upon themselves and
their country in the face of the world, by setting up
one war against another, and dividing the attention of
the public, till impotence and mismanagement should
render peace welcome,—this speech did Colonel Barré
attempt to answer; and did answer it, only in length.
He was sensible that he had disgusted mankind by his
indecent brutality to so great a statesman: his friends
had told him that his invectives, illiberal as they had
been, were reckoned the produce of study; and that
he must shine in cool argument, lest he should be
thought a bully rather than an orator. If they apprehended
this, the result of their lessons was a proof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
that their apprehensions had not been ill-founded.
Nothing could be more cold and dull than Barré’s
reply to Mr. Pitt. It revenged the latter for the former
insult. Calvert,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> a mad volunteer, who always
spoke what he thought, and sometimes thought justly,
was so struck with Barré’s phlegmatic impropriety,
that he told the House it had put him in mind of a
poet, who being at sea in a tempest, and being missed
while all hands were on deck, was found half asleep in
the cabin; and, being asked why he did not assist to
save the ship, replied, he was thinking how to describe
the storm?<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> The money was voted, and nothing more
of consequence passed that session in Parliament.</p>

<p>Both Houses thus complaisant and submissive,
there wanted but the office of prime minister to glut
the Favourite’s ambition: and no wonder that he, who
had dared to strike the name of the first monarch in
military glory in Europe from the list of Great Britain’s
pensioners, only to gratify the feminine piques
of the backstairs; and who had ventured successfully
to remove Mr. Pitt from the command of that country
which he had saved, restored, exalted;—no wonder
such a Phaëton should drive over a ridiculous old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
dotard, who had ever been in everybody’s way, and
whose feeble hands were still struggling for power,
when the most he ought to have expected, was, that
his flattery and obsequiousness might have moved
charity to leave him an appearance of credit. It was
absurd for him to stay in place; insolent to attempt
to stay there by force, and impudent to pretend to
patriotism when driven out with contempt. Against
his will he was preserved from having a share in the
infamy of the ensuing peace.</p>

<p>May 14th, the Duke<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> acquainted the King that he
would resign, who answered coldly, “Then, my Lord,
I must fill up your place as well as I can.” Still
Newcastle lingered; and, as he owned afterwards to
the Duke of Cumberland, his friends had laboured to
prevent the fatal blow. Lord Mansfield, he said, had
<em>pleaded</em> with Lord Bute for above an hour, and could
not extract from him a wish that the Duke should
continue in the Treasury. Fox asked Lord Mansfield
if this was true? He replied, “Not an hour, for I
soon saw it was to no purpose.”</p>

<p>Thus disgraced, and disgracing himself, on the 26th
the Duke of Newcastle resigned: and he, who had
begun the world with heading mobs against the
ministers of Queen Anne; who had braved the Heir-apparent<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>
of the new family, and forced himself upon
him as godfather to his son; who had recovered that
Prince’s favour, and preserved power under him at the
expense of every minister whom that Prince preferred;
and who had been a victorious rival of another Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
of Wales;<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> was now buffeted from a fourth Court<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> by
a very suitable competitor, and was reduced in his
tottering old age to have recourse to those mobs and
that popularity which had raised him fifty years before;
and as almost the individual crisis was revolved, with
a scandalous treaty and a new prospect of arbitrary
power, it looked as if Newcastle thought himself young
again, because the times of his youth were returned,
and he was obliged to act with boys!</p>

<p>Such pains, however, had been taken to disjoint his
faction, that his exit from power was by no means
attended with consolatory circumstances. The Duke
of Devonshire would not resign, though he declared he
would seldom or never go to council. Fox had warned
him not to be too hasty in embarking in a party in
which Pitt must be a principal actor; and remembering
his Grace how large a share Pitt had had in planting
the Tories at Court, and that, speaking of Legge,
Pitt had said, “I will have no more ear for Whig
grievances.” The rest of Newcastle’s friends were as
little disposed to follow him: but that he might taste
the full mortification of being deserted by those whom
he had most obliged, whom he had most courted and
most patronized, the clergy gave the most conspicuous
example of ingratitude. For thirty years Newcastle
had had the almost sole disposal of ecclesiastic preferments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
and consequently had raised numbers of men
from penury and the meanest birth to the highest
honours and amplest incomes in their profession. At
this very period there were not three bishops on the
bench who did not owe their mitres to him. His first
levée after his fall was attended but by one bishop,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>
Cornwallis of Lichfield; who being a man of quality,
and by his birth entitled to expect a greater rise, did
but reflect the more shame on those who owed everything
to favour, and scarce one of them anything to
abilities.</p>

<p>The conduct of Lord Bute was not more wise
than that of Newcastle. Instead of sheltering himself
under that old man’s name from whatever danger
there might be in making peace, the Earl was driving
together all those whom he ought to have kept divided,
and really seemed jealous lest himself should not have
the whole odium of sacrificing the glories and conquests
of the war; an infatuation that so far excuses
him, as he must have thought he did a service to his
country in restoring peace: but what must his understanding
have been if he could think that peace would
be a benefit, let the terms be what they would? He
supposed, too, that Newcastle, having in opposition
to Pitt declared for peace, could not retract, and be
against the peace. This was not knowing Newcastle
or mankind. The situation, too, was materially
changed: the weight of Russia was transferred from
the hostile to the friendly scale; Martinico was fallen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
and Europe could scarce amass the symptom of a fleet.
A mind less versatile than Newcastle’s could not want
arguments against a precipitate treaty. Yet was it
not Newcastle, nor a scandalous treaty that shook the
Favourite’s power. It was his ignorance of the world;
it was a head unadapted to government, and rendered
still less proper for it by morose and recluse pride, and
a heart that was not formed to bear up a weak head,
that made him embark imprudently, and retreat as unadvisedly.</p>

<p>Lord Bute, on the resignation of the Duke of Newcastle,
was immediately declared First Lord of the
Treasury. George Grenville succeeded him as Secretary
of State, and Sir Francis Dashwood was made his
Chancellor of the Exchequer; a system that all the
lustre of the Favourite’s power could not guard from
being ridiculous, though to himself mankind bowed
with obsequious devotion. Grenville was ignorant of
foreign affairs, and, though capable of out-talking the
whole corps diplomatique, had no address, no manner,
no insinuation, and had, least of all, the faculty of listening.
The Favourite himself had never been in a
single office of business, but for the few months that
he had held the seals: of the revenue he was in
perfect ignorance, knew nothing of figures, and was a
stranger to those Magi to the east of Temple-Bar,
who, though they flock to a new star, expect to be
talked to in a more intelligible language than that of
inspiration. When a Lord Treasurer or a First Lord
of the Treasury is not master of his own province, it
suffices if the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a man
of business, and capable of conducting the revenue, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
planning supplies, and of executing the mechanic duties
of that high post. But in the new dispensation
it was difficult to say which was the worst suited to
his office, the minister or his substitute. While the
former shrouded his ignorance from vulgar eyes, and
dropped but now and then from a cloud an oracular
sentence; the deputy, with the familiarity and phrase
of a fish-wife, introduced the humours of Wapping
behind the veil of the Treasury. He had a coarse,
blunt manner of speaking, that, looking like honesty,
inclined men to hold his common sense in higher
esteem than it deserved; but, having neither knowledge<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>
nor dignity, his style, when he was to act as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
minister, appeared naked, vulgar, and irreverent to an
assembly that expects to be informed, and that generally
chooses to reprehend, not to be reprehended.
When a statesman ventures to be familiar, he must
captivate his audience by uncommon graces, or win
their good-will by a humane pleasantry that seems to
flow from the heart, and to be the effusion of universal
benevolence. This was the secret as well as character
of Henry the Fourth of France: even the semblance
of it stood his grandson, our Charles the Second, in
signal stead, and veiled his unfeeling heart, and selfish
and remorseless insensibility.</p>

<p>Men were puzzled to guess at the motive of so improper
a choice as this of Sir Francis Dashwood. The
banner of religion was displayed at Court, and yet all
the centurions were culled from the most profligate
societies. Sir Francis had long been known by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
singularities and some humour. In his early youth,
accoutred like Charles the Twelfth, he had travelled to
Russia in hopes of captivating the Czarina; but neither
the character nor dress of Charles were well
imagined to catch a <em>woman’s</em> heart. In Italy, Sir
Francis had given in to the most open profaneness; and,
at his return, had assembled a society<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> of Young Travellers,
to which a taste for the arts and antiquity, or
merely having travelled, were the recommendatory
ingredients. Their pictures were drawn, ornamented
with symbols and devices; and the founder, in the
habit of St. Francis, and with a chalice in his hand,
was represented at his devotions before a statue of the
Venus of Medicis, a stream of glory beaming on him
from behind her lower hand. These pictures were
long exhibited in their club-room at a tavern in
Palace Yard; but of later years Saint Francis had
instituted a more select order. He and some chosen
friends had hired the ruins of Medmenham Abbey, near
Marlow, and refitted it in a conventual style. Thither
at stated seasons they adjourned; had each their cell,
a proper habit, a monastic name, and a refectory in
common—besides a chapel, the decorations of which
may well be supposed to have contained the quintessence
of their mysteries, since it was impenetrable
to any but the initiated. Whatever their doctrines
were, their practice was rigorously pagan: Bacchus
and Venus were the deities to whom they almost
publicly sacrificed. The old Lord Melcomb was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
of the brotherhood. Yet their follies would have
escaped the eye of the public, if Lord Bute from this
seminary of piety and wisdom had not selected a
Chancellor of the Exchequer. But politics had no
sooner infused themselves amongst these rosy anchorites,
than dissensions were kindled, and a false brother
arose, who divulged the arcana, and exposed the good
Prior, in order to ridicule him as Minister of the
Finances. But, of this, more hereafter.</p>

<p>Every honour the Crown could bestow was now to
be heaped on the Favourite. He was fond of his own
person, and obtained the Garter in company with
Prince William.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> His first levée was crowded like a
triumph. Archbishop Secker, who waited at it, pretended
that, seeing a great concourse as he came from
Lambeth,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> he had inquired the occasion, and had gone
in. Lincoln’s-inn-fields, where the Duke of Newcastle
lived, was not now in the way to Lambeth. About<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the same time died Lord Anson, and left the Admiralty
too at the disposal of the Favourite. He wished
to bestow it on Lord Sandwich, to make room for
Rigby, as Vice-Treasurer of Ireland; but the shyness
of the Duke of Cumberland, whose creature Sandwich
was, made that measure impracticable; and the Admiralty
was bestowed on Lord Halifax, with permission
to retain Ireland for a year. Elliot,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> a chief confident
of the Favourite, was appointed Treasurer of the Chambers;
and Lord Melcombe a cabinet councillor: but
there ended all the ambition of the latter, he dying
of a dropsy in his stomach a few weeks afterwards.</p>

<p>These successes and the tide of power swelled the
weak bladder of the Favourite’s mind to the highest
pitch. His own style was haughty and distant; that
of his creatures insolent. Many persons who had absented
themselves from his levée were threatened with
the loss of their own, or the places of their relations,
and were obliged to bow the knee. But this sunshine
drew up very malignant vapours. Scarce was the
Earl seated but one step below the throne, when a
most virulent weekly paper appeared, called <cite>the North
Briton</cite>. Unawed by the prosecution of the Monitor
(another opponent periodic satire, the author of which
had been taken up for abusing favourites), and though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
combated by two Court papers called the Briton and
the Auditor (the former written by Smollet,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> and the
latter by Murphy,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> and both which the new champion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
fairly silenced in a few weeks), the North Briton proceeded
with an acrimony, a spirit, and a licentiousness
unheard of before even in this country. The highest
names, whether of statesmen or magistrates, were
printed at length, and the insinuations went still
higher. In general, favouritism was the topic, and
the partiality of the Court to the Scots. Every obsolete
anecdote, every illiberal invective, was raked up
and set forth in strong and witty colours against Scotland.
One of the first numbers was one of the most
outrageous, the theme taken from the loves of Queen
Isabella and Mortimer. No doubt but it lay open
enough to prosecution, and the intention was to seize
the author. But on reflection it was not thought advisable
to enter on the discussion of such a subject in
Westminster Hall; and, as the daring audaciousness of
the writer promised little decorum, it was held prudent
to wait till he should furnish a less delicate handle
to vengeance: a circumspection that deceived
and fell heavy on the author, who, being advised to
more caution in his compositions, replied, he had tried
the temper of the Court by the paper on Mortimer,
and found they did not dare to touch him.</p>

<p>This author, who must be so often mentioned in the
following pages, was John Wilkes, member of Parliament
for Ailesbury. He was of a plebeian family,<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>
but inherited a tolerable fortune in Buckinghamshire,
and had been bred at Oxford, where he distinguished
himself by humorous attacks on whatever was esteemed
most holy and respectable. Unrestrained either in
his conduct or conversation, he was allowed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
more wit than in truth he possessed; and, living with
rakes and second-rate authors, he had acquired fame
such as it was, in the middling sphere of life, before
his name was so much as known to the public. His
appearance as an orator had by no means conspired to
make him more noticed. He spoke coldly and insipidly,
though with impertinence; his manner was
poor, and his countenance horrid. When his pen,
which possessed an easy impudent style, had drawn
the attention of mankind towards him, and it was
asked, who this saucy writer was? Fame, that had
adopted him, could furnish but scurvy anecdotes of
his private life. He had married a woman of fortune,
used her ill, and at last cruelly, to extort from her the
provision he had made for her separate maintenance;
he had debauched a maiden of family by an informal
promise of marriage, and had been guilty of other
frauds and breaches of trust. Yet the man, bitter as
he was in his political writings, was commonly not ill-natured
or acrimonious. Wantonness, rather than
ambition or vengeance, guided his hand; and, though
he became the martyr of the best cause, there was
nothing in his principles or morals that led him to
care under what government he lived. To laugh and
riot and scatter firebrands, with him was liberty.
Despotism will for ever reproach Freedom with the
profligacy of such a saint!</p>

<p>Associated with Wilkes in pleasure and in the
composition of the North Briton was a clergyman
named Churchill, who stepped out of obscurity about
the same period, and was as open a contemner of
decency as Wilkes himself, but far his superior in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
the endowments of his mind. Adapted to the bear-garden
by his athletic mould, Churchill had frequented
no school so much as the theatres. He
had existed by the lowest drudgery of his function,
while poetry amused what leisure he could spare, or
rather what leisure he <em>would</em> enjoy; for his Muse, and
his mistress, and his bottle were so essential to his
existence, that they engrossed all but the refuse of
his time. Yet for some years his poetry had proved
as indifferent as his sermons, till a cruel and ill-natured
satire on the actors had, in the first year of
this reign, handed him up to public regard. Having
caught the taste of the town, he proceeded rapidly,
and in a few more publications started forth a giant
in numbers, approaching as nearly as possible to his
model Dryden, and flinging again on the wild neck
of Pegasus the reins which Pope had held with so
tight and cautious a hand. Imagination, harmony,
wit, satire, strength, fire, and sense crowded on his
compositions; and they were welcome for him—he
neither sought nor invited their company. Careless
of matter and manner, he added grace to sense, or
beauty to nonsense, just as they came in his way;
and he could not help being sonorous, even when he
was unintelligible. He advertised the titles of his
poems, but neither planned nor began them till his
booksellers, or his own want of money, forced him
to thrust out the crude but glorious sallies of his
uncorrected fancy. This bacchanalian priest, now
mouthing patriotism, and now venting libertinism,
the scourge of bad men, and scarce better than the
worst, debauching wives, and protecting his gown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
by the weight of his fist, engaged with Wilkes in
his war on the Scots; and sometimes learning, and
as often not knowing, the characters he attacked,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> set
himself up as the Hercules that was to cleanse the
State, and punish its oppressors: and, true it is, the
storm that saved us was raised in taverns and night-cellars;
so much more effectual were the orgies of
Churchill and Wilkes than the daggers of Cato and
Brutus. The two former saved their country, while
Catiline could not ruin his,—a work to which such
worthies seemed much better adapted.</p>

<p>But while the wit and revelry of Wilkes and
Churchill ran riot, and were diverted by their dissipation
to other subjects of pleasantry or satire,
they had a familiar at their ear, whose venom was
never distilled at random, but each drop administered
to some precious work of mischief. This was Earl
Temple, who whispered them where they might find
torches, but took care never to be seen to light one
himself. Characters so rash and imprudent were
proper vehicles of his spite; and he enjoyed the two
points he preferred even to power,—vengeance, and a
whole skin.</p>

<p>This triumvirate has made me often reflect that
nations are most commonly saved by the worst men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
in them. The virtuous are too scrupulous to go the
lengths that are necessary to rouse the people against
their tyrants.</p>

<p>While Wilkes and Churchill attacked the plenitude
of the Favourite’s power, another cloud overcast
it, which, though inconsiderable and of short duration,
contributed to lower him in the estimation of
the people. An account arrived of the French having
surprised and made themselves masters of Newfoundland.
General Amherst<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> did not wait for orders
from hence, but, detaching his brother with a body
of forces, recovered the island, and made the French
commander prisoner.</p>

<p>Prince Ferdinand, not less active and vigilant, had
surprised the French camp, desirous of embarking
us farther in the war, and hoping that new successes
would animate the nation to resist the propensity
of the Court for peace. General Conway took the
castle of Waldeck by stratagem; and the Hessians
triumphed in other attempts.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> The Prince told Mr.
Conway that we might be joined by a body of Russians
for a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trait de plume</i>, but neither miscarriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
nor success could beat the Favourite from his plan
of pacification; though, had we been inclined to
listen to that overture, a second change of scene in
Russia would have disconcerted our treating with
that nation.</p>

<p>Peter the Third, with a humane heart, had neither
judgment nor patience. He meant to do right, and
thought absolute power could not be better employed
than in doing right without delay. His approbation
and contempt were prompt and strongly marked;
and, as his understanding was incapable of embracing
many objects, his few ideas took the larger possession
of him. Being educated a Lutheran, he despised
the clergy of his empire, and had offended the soldiery
by enforcing discipline, by restoring the conquests
of the preceding reign, by manifesting indiscreet
predilection for a regiment of Holstein, his native
country, and by so blind a devotion to the King
of Prussia, that himself wore that Prince’s uniform.
Indolence and drunkenness were added to this want
of conduct; but he had to struggle with a yet more
dangerous evil. The late Czarina, his aunt, finding
no issue arise from his marriage with the Princess
of Anhalt Zerbst, questioned the latter; and, it is
said, was informed by her that she must not expect
any lineage from her nephew. Elizabeth replied,
the State demanded successors, and left the Grand
Duchess at liberty to procure them by whose assistance
she pleased. A son and daughter were
the fruits of her obedience. But, though her politics
were satisfied, it is said the mind of Elizabeth was
not, and that she privately saw her cousin, the dethroned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Czar Yvan. The opinion is general, though
at what time it happened is uncertain, that drugs to
destroy his understanding had been administered to
that poor Prince. Peter, though on obtaining the
diadem he openly exhibited a mistress, could not but
know that if his wife had spoken truth, he could
have no claim to be father of her children: thence
he had the same curiosity as his aunt, visited the
Czar Yvan, and, as the rumour went, intended to
name him his successor. Such rumours were sufficient
to alarm the Empress, who was slighted by
Peter, and had reason to think he meant to divorce
her. That bold bad woman, who had all the talents
for empire that her husband wanted, and who had
been educated by a most artful and intriguing mother,
and who, with a commanding person, had a
heart susceptible of warm impressions, was then under
the influence of Orloff, her lover, and her confident
the Princess Daskau, a young woman little above
twenty years of age, but of an adventurous spirit,
and, what made her situation singular, sister of the
Emperor’s mistress.</p>

<p>This junto agreed to believe that Peter would
not limit his aversion for the Empress to mere
divorce, but intended to put her to death; a charge
most improbable, and inconsistent with the Emperor’s
humane and unsuspecting nature. How early a conspiracy
was formed, I pretend not to say; nor, in
relating the events of so distant a country, and
whence truth is so difficult to be procured, do I
pretend to give more than the outlines of their
general story, collected from the most credible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
authority. But, however dark and secret the measures
were, the facts resulting from them were so
glaring, so horrid, so impious, that neither the
lying palliatives set forth by the criminals themselves,
nor the mercenary flattery of the learned,
will be able to wash off from the Empress the foul
stains of treason, murder, and usurpation.</p>

<p>The Emperor had not reigned above six months,
when the plan for dethroning him was formed,
and ready to break forth. One of the conspirators
being arrested for another crime, the rest concluded
the whole was discovered; but, instead of dispersing
or seeking safety by flight, the chiefs trusted to rashness
for impunity. Orloff galloped off to the Czarina,
who was absent from the capital at a separate villa
from the Emperor, and told her she had not a
moment to lose. That virago having ordered her
women to report she was confined by sickness, and
placing guards upon the road to prevent notice of
her march being sent to the Czar, rode directly to
the army and demanded their protection. One only
regiment, that of Holstein, refused their support.
All the rest saluted her Empress; and the clergy
who trembled for their idols, and resented the loss
of their beards, ran headlong into rebellion. The
senate, the nobility, the people, all concurred to raise
to the throne in her own name a woman who had
no one claim of any sort to be their sovereign.</p>

<p>Nariskin, master of the horse, was the sole subject
who had fidelity enough to make his escape
and inform the Emperor of the catastrophe that
awaited him. That poor prince was at Oraniebaum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
a villa. Thunderstruck with the news, he had not
presence of mind to prepare himself to save either
his empire or his life. He lost both by losing a
day, which he wasted in drinking and vain consultation,
after having fruitlessly sent to Peterhoff to
secure the Empress. Next morning he heard that
his wife at the head of fourteen thousand men was
marching to seize him. He then attempted to make
his escape to Holstein, and embarked for Cronstadt—but
it was too late! The garrison had received
orders to fire on him. Exhausted with perturbation
of mind, with drink and fatigue, he sunk under
his misfortunes, surrendered himself, and desired to
see his wife, now his sovereign. As incapable of
pity as of remorse, she refused to admit him, ordering
him to sign a renunciation of his crown, and
a most humiliating recapitulation of his errors. Nor
did this avail: within very few days he was murdered.</p>

<p>Thus far Catherine had acted like other monsters of
both sexes. Her next measures were as weak towards
men as they were profane in the face of Heaven. In
very silly manifestoes she endeavoured to justify her
crimes; and dared even to call on the Most High as
the instigator of her abominations, speaking of her
husband but as her neighbour, and of his death as a
judgment. Vain and contemptible was this attempt:
it could blind none but those who would be willing to
acquit her without it.</p>

<p>The Princess Daskau soon lost the favour she had
so blackly merited; and Rosamouski, Hetman of the
Tartars, whom many accused as the very assassin of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
his master, but who, as his friends urged, was forced
into the conspiracy, went into a voluntary exile. Orloff
had gained deeper hold on his mistress, and kept her
in subjection. Panin, governor of her son, was another
of the principal conspirators. Bestucheff, the late
chancellor, was recalled; and thus he, Count Munich,
Biron, once Duke of Courland, and master of the empire,
with the various exiles of the late reigns, found
themselves again together at Petersburgh.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p>After the murdered Prince himself, no man was
likely to be more affected by this revolution than the
King of Prussia. The Russians, so lately his enemies,
had not been pleased to become his allies. But,
though the new Empress was necessitated to comply
with the wishes of her subjects in withdrawing them
from that service, she was not disposed in so critical a
situation to renew the war, or to add provocation to
a man whom she had deprived of so useful and essential
a friend. She therefore only made the requisition
of the thirty thousand Russians in his service, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
allowed him for a few days to profit by their assistance,
and extricate himself out of this new difficulty. He
returned for answer, that he would only drive Marshal
Daun from the hills before him, and her troops should
return. He did so. This was taking his part with
admirable presence of mind. He knew that Daun
must in a day or two learn the departure of the Russian
troops, and would attack him when weakened.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August, the Queen was delivered of
a Prince of Wales; and the same morning the treasure
of that capital prize, the Hermione, arrived in
town in many waggons, and passed through the City
to the Tower. The sum taken amounted to near eight
hundred thousand pounds.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the following month came the
first news from the Havannah; and before the end of
it we learned the entire conquest of that important
place by the three Keppels,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a>—the Earl of Albemarle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
the Commodore and the Colonel his brothers. The
honour they won was a little soiled by their rapaciousness
and by our great loss of men: but to Spain the
blow was of the deepest consequence, and the place
irrecoverable by any force they could exert. Yet such
a victory seemed to infuse as little joy into the Court
of St. James’s as into that of Madrid. The Favourite
and his creatures took no part in the transports of the
nation; and, when he declined availing himself of any
merit from the conquest, it was plain he was grieved
either to have more to restore at the peace, or less
reason for making that peace but on the most advantageous
terms: but he was infatuated, and, breaking
through all the barriers of glory, he sent the Duke
of Bedford to Paris to settle the preliminaries,
whence the Duc de Nivernois arrived for the same
purpose.</p>

<p>Sullen and silent as Mr. Pitt was, and feeble and
impotent as the faction of Newcastle, still the City
and merchants showed some symptoms of indignation
at this obstinate alacrity for treating. The Duke of
Bedford was hissed as he passed through the principal
streets; and treasonable papers were dispersed in the
villages round London. But in France the Duke was
received as their guardian angel. The most distinguished
and unusual honours were paid to him; and
the principal magistrate of Calais, thinking him descended
from the other John Duke of Bedford, brother
of Henry the Fifth, complimented his Grace (and no
doubt felicitated himself on the comparison) on seeing
him arrive with as salutary and pacific, as his great
ancestor had formerly landed there with hostile intentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
His counterpart, the Duc de Nivernois, had been
long employed in negotiations at Rome and Berlin,
but had not the good fortune to please at the latter
Court, where the King even turned into ridicule his
puny and emaciated little figure. His ill-health, the
titles that had centred in his person, and had filled
him with vanity (for he was Peer of France, Prince of
the Empire, Grandee of Spain, and a Roman Baron),
and his affection for polite learning, had disposed him
to live in a retired circle of humble admirers, to whom
he almost daily repeated his works both in prose and
verse; but not without having attempted to soar
higher. He had assumed devotion, in hopes of being
Governor to the Dauphin: but, except in concluding
the peace, which, considering our eagerness, he could
not avoid concluding, he had never met with brilliant
success in any of his pursuits; being, as the celebrated
Madame Geoffrin<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> said of him, “Guerrier manqué, politique
manqué, bel esprit manqué, enfin manqué partout.”
To England he bore no good-will: and though,
till the treaty was signed, he concealed, as much
as peevishness would let him, the disgust he took to
this country, and was profuse in attentions to all, and
in assiduity of court to the Favourite and his faction,
yet, though he remained here a very little time after
the signature, his nature broke forth, and scarce was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
enough good-breeding left to skin over the sore reluctance
of a momentary stay.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>The nation was far less impatient than the Court for
peace; and, though no great burst of spirit appeared
against it, there were sufficient symptoms of ill-humour
to warn the prime minister, that, without redoubling
his industry and taking more solid measures,
he might still be foiled in the attempt of forcing an
inglorious peace on the nation. Beckford, who had
been desirous of resigning his alderman’s gown, was,
against his will, elected Lord Mayor; a mark of their
good-will to his friend, Mr. Pitt. The North Briton
spread the alarm as much as possible; but the flippancy
of the author began to draw storms on his own
head. Wilkes having in one of those papers ridiculed
the flattery of Lord Talbot, who, officiating as Lord
High Constable at the Coronation, had endeavoured
to back his horse to the gate of Westminster Hall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
that he might not turn his own back on the King,
was challenged by Lord Talbot; and after a series of
letters, which had more the air of a treaty than a
defiance, and consequently reflected no great honour
on either, they fought a bloodless duel on Bagshot
Heath.</p>

<p>These little rubs having alarmed the Favourite, he
began to consider how ill-qualified his delegates would
be to support his treaty in the House of Commons,
if either warmly or wittily attacked. It was too precious
a cause to trust to Sir Francis Dashwood. Grenville
had not much more credit, though more sense
and gravity; but was tedious and ill-heard, and had
been trained to such obsequious deference for Mr.
Pitt, that at that time no man thought him likely or
proper to be opposed to so capital a master. Grenville
was besides unsatisfied; and, aiming higher, had
been unwilling to risk an appearance of honesty when
it was not in his own cause. He had neglected to
traffic with the members of the House of Commons;
had secured none of them; and, being pressed by Lord
Bute on that head, fairly owned he would not deal
with them, unless the power was his own, and their dependence
rested on him. Lord Bute was startled, and
would have compromised, as himself was unacquainted
with the men, that the recommendation of members
to favour,—that is, to places and pensions,—should be
made through Grenville to himself. But Grenville
was obstinate, and soon had cause to repent both his
frankness and perverse ambition. It was instilled too
into Lord Bute, that Grenville was not so much at
variance with his family as he wished to be thought—an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
imputation of which he soon appeared to be guiltless:
but the die was cast; and he heard with unspeakable
astonishment, and with a rage not to be
described, that he must exchange with Lord Halifax,
that is, return to be First Lord of the Admiralty, and
quit the seals, and with them the management of the
House of Commons, which Mr. Fox had consented to
undertake. The blow to Grenville was grievous, but
could not be avoided or resented—<em>then</em>. No retreat
towards his brothers Pitt and Temple was left him.
Avarice decided the conflict, and he submitted to
accept the Admiralty.</p>

<p>When Fox thus stooped to be the Favourite’s agent,
he gratified many more passions than he could be supposed
to mortify. In truth, except his pride, which
had seldom restrained him, what views could he have
but this step would gratify? To ravish the glories of
the war from his rival Mr. Pitt, to sacrifice them, and
to be selected to defend that sacrifice, glutted his
spirit of competition. Favourite he could not be, for
the Princess<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> hated, and Lord Bute feared him: but
to be necessary to both was worth ambition, and the
surest means of gratifying it; and to be master of the
secret of the negotiation promised that superabundance
of wealth, which by that secret he acquired.
Should he succeed in carrying through the peace, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
would have the first weight in the House of Commons
(for what harmony there was between these <em>rival
friends</em> may readily be conjectured); should he fail, it
were but the loss of the Paymaster’s place, inconsiderable
in peace compared with its produce in time of
war: for it must be noted that he would not accept
the seals, and thus stood in no responsible light; a
strain of prudence that might have administered alarm
to the Favourite himself!</p>

<p>Thus in the space of four months were the Princess
and Lord Bute by their rash and ill-digested measures
reduced to lean for support on Fox, whom they had
most dreaded as the minister of the Duke of Cumberland;
and who would add his own unpopularity to
that of Lord Bute, and would necessarily determine
Pitt to oppose with increased resentment.</p>

<p>Fox had embraced this invitation with such alacrity
that he had signed the treaty with Lord Bute without
consulting any of his friends; concluding, as over-refined
politicians are apt to do, that he could bring
them to his lure, and, while he paid too high compliments
to his own abilities, setting too slight estimation
on theirs. His first application was to the Duke
of Cumberland. That haughty and sensible Prince
received him with scorn, reproached him warmly with
lending himself to support a tottering administration,
and bitterly with his former declarations of having
given up all ambitious views. The next trial made by
Fox was on Lord Waldegrave,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> to whom he urged
that his Lordship had so much ridiculed the Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
and Lord Bute, that they had more to complain of
than he had; and he endeavoured to enclose the Earl
in his treaty with the Court, by asking him, if it
should be proposed to call his Lordship to the Cabinet
Council, whether he should like it? The Earl, who
had been bred a courtier, who was of too gentle
manners for opposition, and too shrewd not to see
that the power of the Crown was predominant, desired
time to consider, and went to Windsor to consult the
Duke of Cumberland. His Royal Highness acknowledged
the attention with many thanks, but would
give no advice. The Earl, who wanted not to be told,
that not advising him to make his court when he was
disposed to do it, was advising him against it, was not
courtier enough to quit a Prince, his friend, for a
Court that he himself despised and hated; and immediately
wrote to Fox to desire the proposal might not
be made to him. The Duke of Devonshire<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> was in
like manner endeavoured to be softened by Fox, who
wished to wear the credit of reconciling his own
friends to the peace, and bringing their support to the
administration. But here again he was foiled. The
Duke gave him a civil answer, assured him of his personal
good wishes, but declined any connection with
him as minister.</p>

<p>Abandoned by his highest and most showy friends,
Fox felt the mortification of discredit both with his
patron and the public, and the keenest appetite for
revenge. As a politician, his credit was saved by his
industry and success; and by his arts his vengeance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
was soon gratified on two of those that thus cast him
off. But now were the seeds sown, which, though
slowly, produced such bitter crops in subsequent years.
Detested by the public, Fox could never recover from
the stain contracted at this period:—but first we must
relate his triumph, and the temporary victory he
gained for the Court.</p>

<p>Nothing was so unpromising as the prospect of the
new system at first. All the devotion of the Tories to
the Court could not reconcile them to the nomination
of Fox. They knew the mischief he had done them,
and had not the quickness to see that a renegade is tied
to make satisfaction by greater benefits. Lord Mansfield,
not trusted, as he had expected to be, by Lord
Bute, had blown up discontents against the peace.
Lord Egremont and George Grenville had adopted
those doubts; and doubts from men in high place
convey extensive influence. Had the peace been instantaneously
proposed to the House of Commons,
there is no question but it would have been rejected;
so strong a disgust was taken at the union of Bute
and Fox, and so numerous were their several personal
enemies. Yet in one respect Bute had chosen judiciously:
Fox was not to be daunted, but set himself
to work at the root. He even made applications to
Newcastle; but the Duke of Cumberland<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> had inspired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
even Newcastle and Devonshire with resolution!
This, however, was the last miscarriage of moment
that Fox experienced. Leaving the grandees
to their ill-humour, he directly attacked the separate
members of the House of Commons; and with so
little decorum on the part of either buyer or seller,
that a shop was publicly opened at the Pay-office,
whither the members flocked, and received the wages
of their venality in bank-bills, even to so low a sum
as two hundred pounds for their votes on the treaty.
Twenty-five thousand pounds, as Martin,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> Secretary of
the Treasury, afterwards owned, were issued in one
morning; and in a single fortnight a vast majority was
purchased to approve the peace!</p>

<p>Bad as that peace proved, it was near being concluded
on terms still more disadvantageous; for France,
receiving earlier intelligence than we did of the capture
of the Havannah, had near prevailed on the Duke
of Bedford to sign the treaty,—but Aldworth,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
secretary, had the prudence or foresight to prevent
that precipitate step.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>The Court having secured the obedience of Parliament,
it was determined to assume a high tone of
authority; to awe, and even to punish the refractory.
“The King, it was given out, <em>would</em> be King,—would
<em>not</em> be dictated to by his ministers, as his grandfather
had been. The prerogative was to shine out: great
lords must be humbled.” Fox—whose language ever
was, that the Crown must predominate whenever it
would exert its influence—warmly upheld the doctrine
of rewards and punishments; and, having employed
the former with so much success, he was rejoiced
to inflict the latter to glut his own vengeance.
The first fruit of these councils struck mankind with
astonishment. The Duke of Devonshire, who had kept
himself in the country, coming to town on the 28th
of October, went to pay his duty to the King, and, as
is customary with the great officers, went to the backstairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
whence he sent the page in waiting to acquaint
his Majesty with his attendance. “Tell him,” said
the King angrily, “I will not see him.” The page,
amazed, hesitated. The King ordered him to go and
deliver those very words. If the page had been thunderstruck,
it may be imagined what the Duke felt.
He had, however, the presence of mind to send in the
page again to ask what he should do with his key of
Lord Chamberlain. The reply was, “Orders will be
given for that.” The Duke went home with a heart
full of rage, and tore off his key, which immediately
after he carried to Lord Egremont, the Secretary of
State; and the next morning his brother Lord George
Cavendish, and Lord Besborough<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> his brother-in-law,
resigned their places. As the Court urged that the
Duke’s disgrace was owing to his refusal of attending
Councils, his Grace’s friends pleaded that he had asked
and obtained the King’s leave not to attend them, as
he seldom had attended them even in the late reign;
and that, his summons having been made by a commis
in Lord Egremont’s office, the Duke did not
think that such a message interfered with his dispensation.
Some said there had been no intention to dismiss
the Duke; attributing the affront to a sudden start
of passion in the King, who, coming from Richmond
that morning, had met the Dukes of Devonshire and
Newcastle together in a chariot, whence suspecting a
Cabal, he had gone home in anger, and, at the moment
the Duke arrived at St. James’s, was writing to Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Bute that <em>now was the time</em>; words which proved at
least that the Duke’s disgrace had been meditated,
and which in truth nobody doubted. The Princess
had more than once termed him ironically <em>the Prince of
the Whigs</em>; and his Grace having dared to desert from
Fox’s banner, left no doubt of the latter having contributed
to irritate the prejudice already conceived.
Nor could Fox wipe off the suspicion: though, as soon
as the affront was known, he had hurried to Devonshire
House,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> and protested his utter ignorance of any
such design. The Duke received him coolly, did not
pretend to believe him; and his family never forgave it.</p>

<p>The fairness of the Duke’s character, his decent and
timid caution, and the high rank in which he stood
with the party, made the measure much wondered at;
yet it was far from producing such open offence as
might have been expected, nor did the consequences
spread. The Marquis of Rockingham, five days afterwards,
resigned the Bedchamber; but, offering to explain
his disgusts, the King with much haughtiness
refused to hear him—another strain of authority much
vaunted, and not without effect. The Peerage itself
kissed the rod, which was declared to be held out to
humble them. Nor did they take the alarm, though the
rigour towards the Duke of Devonshire was prosecuted
farther; for, a Privy Council being summoned November<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the 3rd, the King ordered the Duke’s name to be
struck out of the Council-book: a severity of which
there had been no precedent in the last reign but in
the cases of Lord Bath and Lord George Sackville;
the first, in open and virulent opposition; the second
on his ignominious sentence after the battle of Minden.
John Duke of Argyle,<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> when his regiment was taken
from him, was not thus affronted; nor had George
the First refused to admit Lord Oxford<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> to kiss his
hand on the Queen’s death, nor denied an audience to
the Earl Marichal<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> involved in Jacobitism.</p>

<p>On the 8th of the month a courier arrived with the
preliminaries signed by France and Spain. I shall not
detail those preliminaries, too well known, and to be
found in all common histories. It is my part to explain,
as far as I could know them, the leading motives
of actions and events; and, though the secret
springs are often unfathomable, I had acquaintance
enough with the actors to judge with better probability
than the common of mankind; and where these
memoirs are defective or mistaken, still they may direct
to the inquiry after sounder materials, and prove
a key to original papers that may appear hereafter.</p>

<p>The peace with Spain, as it opened a door for an
embassy to that Court, afforded Mr. Fox a new opportunity
of revenge; and as this measure at least he
could not waive the honour of having suggested, so did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
it corroborate the belief of his being the author of the
other too.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> He immediately offered that embassy to
Lord Sandwich,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> who as greedily accepted it. Sandwich,
rejected and exploded by all mankind, had been
adopted, fostered, patronized in the most kind and
intimate manner by the Duke of Cumberland; nor
had he the confidence now to consult his Royal Highness,
or to venture in person to notify to him his desertion.
He wrote. The insult was too glaring, and
could not be pardoned to either Fox or Sandwich,
both of whom were for ever excluded from the Duke’s
presence but at his public levées, and there underwent
the most mortifying neglect from him; though
Fox often sued in most abject manner to be forgiven.</p>

<p>Severity gratified, honours and preferments were
amply proffered, and but few rejected. The Duke of
Manchester<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> had been named to the Bedchamber the
instant Lord Rockingham had quitted it. The Duke
of Marlborough<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> and the Earl of Northumberland<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a>
were made Lords Chamberlains to the King and
Queen; the latter of which posts Lord Bristol had
refused to accept, from attachment to Mr. Pitt. Lord
Egmont was made Postmaster in the room of Lord
Besborough. The seals of Secretary of State, with the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">feuille de bénéfices</i>, were once more offered to the Duke
of Newcastle; but he replied, it would be time enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
to talk of business when the Parliament met. His
friend, Lord Ashburnham,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> resigned: and so did his
other friend, Lord Kinnoul,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> who, though his bosom-confident,
dwelling in his very house, had borne
his disgrace, and now affected to forget him, and to
plead obligations to the Duke of Devonshire, at the
same time declaring his reluctance to break with the
Court; a reluctance so decisive, that he retired into
Scotland, and came no more to London till the year
1770.</p>

<p>Lord Lincoln,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> Newcastle’s favourite nephew and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
heir, displayed more open ingratitude. He asked an
audience of the King, called his uncle a factious old
fool, and said he could not forget a message which
himself had brought from his uncle to his Majesty in
the year 1757, in which the Duke had signified to his
then Royal Highness, that, if he would not disturb the
tranquillity of the rest of his grandfather’s reign, the
Duke, in or out of place, though he hoped the latter,
would support his measures to the utmost. It was
justice, to recollect this promise; but Lincoln’s subsequent
conduct, at the same time that it was inconsistent,
was honourable neither towards the King nor
his uncle. He had a second audience, in which he told
the King that the Duke insisted on his resigning;
“but if I must,” said he, “I will show but the more
warmly the next day that I remember the message, of
which I have kept a copy in writing.” The third
time, when he went to resign, he said he must oppose.
The King told him his tone was much changed since
his first audience. But the Court never had much
reason to complain of Lord Lincoln’s hostilities. His
exceeding pride kept him secluded from the world,
and rarely did he appear either at Court or in Parliament.
For some time he fluctuated between Lord
Bute and Mr. Pitt, to the latter of whom he at last
attached himself; but with constant derision of, and
insult to, his uncle, and, whatever were the Duke of
Newcastle’s faults, cruel and unmerited. The truth
was, Lord Lincoln’s avarice was as unbounded as his
haughtiness. Though possessed of two places for life,
and one of them the most lucrative in England, the
auditorship of the Exchequer, which never produces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
less than eight thousand pounds a year, and during
the war had brought in at least twenty, he had resented
the Duke’s not bestowing on him two more
places for the lives of his younger sons.</p>

<p>As every door was to be opened or barricaded that
could admit or exclude friends or enemies to the preliminaries,
messengers were stationed at the sea-ports
to waylay Lord Granby on his return from the army,
with the most advantageous offers, as the Ordnance
and command of the army, setting aside the worthy
old Marshal Ligonier<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> with a large pension; a bait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
gulped by the former without scruple. Mr. Conway,
to whom they did the honour of thinking they could
not bribe him, (and whoever they could not bribe, they
concluded, could not approve their treaty,) was decorated
with the empty honour of conducting home the army;
which would and did prevent his return before the discussion
of the preliminaries in Parliament. And the
Duke of York, whom they would not silence by favours,
they obliged to go on an idle expedition to Italy.</p>

<p>The profusion exercised on this occasion, and which
reduced the Court to stop even the payments of the
King’s bedchamber, made men recall severely to mind
the King’s declaration on the choice of the Parliament,
that he would not permit any money to be spent on
elections.</p>

<p>Their greatest difficulty was with Charles Townshend,
who slipped through their fingers at every turn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
and could be held down to no decision. He refused
to be First Lord of Trade with the same power over
the colonies as had been granted to Lord Halifax. At
the same time he was loth to resign, though in that
quarter the needle rested at last,—a mark of that want
of judgment that was conspicuous in all his actions;
for, having fluctuated from uncertainty of the issue,
he chose the losing side but the very day before the
great victory of the Court on the preliminaries. His
post of Secretary at War was soon after given to Ellis.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>
Townshend’s bons mots wounded where his conduct
could not. It being reported, to justify the treatment
of the Duke of Devonshire, that the King complained
he had been kept prisoner; “True,” said Townshend,
“he is a prisoner, but he mistakes his jailor.” Another
of his sayings had not only proved a prophecy,
but was often applied in the following years. He had
said of the last arrangement before Fox was set at the
head, that “it was a pretty lutestring administration,
which would do very well for summer wear.”</p>

<p>After so many considerable names, it will look, perhaps,
like vain presumption in me to name myself as
one whom it was thought necessary to manage. But,
as it proves how low the arts and attention of Fox
could descend, and as my answer (at least, I have
always suspected so) contributed to an event of much
consequence afterwards, I shall be excused by the
candid for giving some account of it. I had, soon after
my appearance in the world, lived in much intimacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
with Fox, had warmly espoused his side when persecuted
by the Duke and Duchess of Richmond,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> and
had happened to have conferred some other little
favours on him. I had carefully avoided receiving the
smallest or the greatest from him. As his character
opened more to the world, I declined any connection
with him in politics, though determining never to
have a quarrel with him, as I well knew his vindictive
nature. When he united with the Duke of Newcastle,
he had offered in truth slightly enough to procure the
reversion of a considerable place, which I hold only
for my brother’s life, to be confirmed for my own, provided
I would be upon good terms with the Duke. I
had ever, in the most open manner, spoken of that
minister with contempt; and having never to this hour
received a favour from any minister, I shall be believed
that I never would accept one from Fox. I answered
accordingly with much scorn, “I will not accept that
reversion from the Duke.” Fox, knowing this spirit,
and knowing, too, that I had declared to Lord Bute
that I would receive no favour from the Court, had no
hope of fixing me to his measures by any offers he
could make. Nor yet had he had reason to know I was
averse to the preliminaries, on which I had kept silent.
The truth was, I had been civilly treated on the King’s
accession, and had so much disliked Newcastle and
Hardwicke, that few men were better pleased than
myself to see a new administration; and had not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
standard of Prerogative been hoisted, and disgrace
brought on this triumphant country, I should probably
have remained a satisfied spectator. Yet was I not
so steeled by the glories of the war as to be insensible
to the yearnings of humanity; and therefore,
ignominious as the articles were, my conscience
would not suffer me to speak against a treaty that
would stop such effusion of blood. Sentiments, I
confess, most heroic: yet I blush not to own that
they divided my sensations, and forbad my voting
<em>against</em> the preliminaries, though I was too much an
Englishman to vote <em>for</em> them, and accordingly left the
House before the putting of the question.</p>

<p>As doubtless I did not trust Fox with this situation
of my breast, nor made my court on his new dignity,
he concluded I was in the number of the disapprovers.
Direct offers, or direct threats, would be vain: but to
put me in mind of my dependence on my nephew, by
whose interest I was chosen into Parliament,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> and
which dependence Fox ought to have remembered I
had braved<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> for his sake; or of my dependence on
the Treasury, which could hurt me severely<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> by stopping
the payments of my place in the Treasury; he
wrote me the following <span class="locked">letter:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<blockquote class="b2">
<p class="sigright b0">Nov. 21, 1762.</p>
<p class="p0 in0"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>As soon as I heard that the Parks,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> which Lord
Ashburnham had quitted, were worth 2200<i>l.</i> a year
(as they certainly are), I thought such an income
might, if not prevent, at least procrastinate your
nephew’s ruin.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> I find nobody knows his Lordship’s<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a>
thoughts on the present state of politics.</p>

<p>Perhaps he has none. Now, are you willing, and
are you the proper person, to tell Lord Orford that I
will do my best to procure this employment for him,
if I can soon learn that he desires it? If he does
choose it, I doubt not of his and his friend Boone’s<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a>
hearty assistance, and believe I shall see you too, much
oftener in the House of Commons. This is offering
you a bribe, but ’tis such a one as one honest good-natured
man may without offence offer to another.</p>

<p>If you undertake this, do it immediately, and have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
attention to my part in it, which is delicate. If you
do not undertake it, let me know your thoughts of the
proposal, whether I had better drop it entirely, or
put it into other hands, and whose.</p>

<p>You’ll believe me when I tell you that goodness of
heart has as much share in this to the full as policy.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Yours ever,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">H. Fox</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This artful and disingenuous letter the messenger
was ordered to desire I would answer immediately. I
determined at once to guard my expressions in such
a manner, that, under the appearance of the same
insincere cordiality which Fox affected to wear, it
should not be possible to fix either declaration or
engagement upon me; showing him at the same time
that I would neither accept favour from him, nor
be indirectly obliged to him through my nephew.
I was aware that, if I refused to notify the offer to
Lord Orford, he or his friends, and the Court too,
would raise a clamour against me for preventing his
receiving a favour that he wanted so much: and, as he
was already Lord of the Bedchamber, there could be
no reason in honour why he should not accept an
addition of income; nor was there anything in his
principles that would make him difficult to be farther
bound. With these views I returned the following
<span class="locked">answer:—</span></p>

<blockquote class="b2">
<p class="sigright b0">Nov. 21, 1762.</p>
<p class="in0 p0"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>After having done<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> what the world knows I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
done, to try to retrieve the affairs of my family, and
to save my nephew from ruin, I can have little hopes
that any interposition of mine will tend to an end I
wish so much. I cannot even flatter myself with
having the least weight with my Lord Orford. In
the present case I can still less indulge myself in any
such hopes. You remember in the case of the St.
Michael election, how hardly he used me on your
account. I know how much he resented last year his
thinking you concerned in the contest about the
borough<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> where he set up Mr. Thomas Walpole; and,
as he has not even now deigned to answer Mr.
Boone’s letter,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> I can little expect that he will behave
with more politeness to me. Yet, I think it so much
my duty to lay before him anything for his advantage,
and what is by no means incompatible with his
honour, that I will certainly acquaint him immediately
with the offer you are so good as to make him.</p>

<p>You see I write to you with my usual frankness
and sincerity; and you will, I am sure, be so good as
to keep to yourself the freedom with which I mention
very nice family affairs. You must excuse me if
I add one word more on myself. My wish is, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Lord Orford should accept this offer; yet, I tell you
truly, I shall state it to him plainly and simply, without
giving any advice, not only for the reasons I have
expressed above, but because I do not mean to be
involved in this affair any otherwise than as a messenger.
A man, who is so scrupulous as not to accept
any obligation for himself, cannot be allowed to accept
one for another without thinking himself bound in
gratitude as much as if done to himself. The very
little share I ever mean to take more in public affairs
shall and must be dictated by disinterested motives.
I have no one virtue to support me but that disinterestedness;
and, if I act with you, no man living
shall have it to say that it was not by choice and by
principle.</p>

<span class="l2">Your sincere humble servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Horace Walpole</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>There were truths enough to displease, and they did
not escape Fox. The consequence to me was, that by
his influence with Martin, Secretary of the Treasury,
my payments were stopped for some months, nor made
but on my writing to Lord Bute himself; which, as,
notwithstanding this persecution, I would take no part
with the administration, proved that the delay had not
flowed from the minister himself, but from his associate,
my good friend: nor did it stop there. In the
meantime I had written thus to Lord <span class="locked">Orford:—</span></p>

<blockquote class="b2">
<p class="sigright b0">Arlington-street, Nov. 22, 1762.</p>
<p class="p0 in0"><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>,</p>

<p>I must preface what I am going to say, with
desiring you to believe that I by no means take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
liberty of giving you any advice; and should the proposal
I have to make to you be disagreeable, I beg you
to excuse it, as I thought it my duty to lay before you
anything that is for your advantage, and as you would
have reason to blame me if I declined communicating
to you a lucrative offer.</p>

<p>I last night received a letter from Mr. Fox, in
which he tells me, that, hearing the Parks, vacant by
Lord Ashburnham’s resignation, are worth 2200<i>l.</i> a
year, he will, if you desire to succeed him, do his best
to procure that employment for you, if he can soon
learn that it is your wish.</p>

<p>If you will be so good as to send me your answer, I
will acquaint him with it; or, if you think it more
polite to thank Mr. Fox himself for his obliging offer,
I shall be very well content to be, as I am in everything
else, a cypher, except when I can show myself,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">My dear Lord,</span><br />
<span class="l2">Your very affectionate humble servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Horace Walpole</span>.

<p>To this letter, nor to the offer, did Lord Orford
give himself the trouble of making the least reply;
but, arriving in town on the very day the Parliament
met, he came to me, and asked what he was to do?
I replied very coldly, I did not know what he intended
to do; but, if his meaning was to accept, I supposed
he ought to go to Mr. Fox, and tell him so, I having
nothing farther to do with it than barely to acquaint
him with the offer. Without preface or apology, without
recollecting his long enmity to Fox (it is true,
he did not know why he was Fox’s enemy), and without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
a hint of reconciliation, to Fox he went, accepted
the place, and never gave that ministry one vote afterwards;
continuing in the country, as he would have
done if they had given him nothing. I return from
this digression.</p>

<p>The rupture between the Duke of Cumberland and
Fox seemed naturally to pave the way for a connection
between that Prince and Mr. Pitt. They accordingly
met, and had a conference of four hours; but
there their amity commenced and ended. The good
sense of his Royal Highness could, in spite of all his
haughtiness, make him bend properly. Pitt, having
less good sense than parts, and affecting more haughtiness
even than he possessed, and being full of schemes
rather than plans, could not be brought to any rational
system. Meaning to make use of the Prince but to a
certain degree,—that is, to thwart the Court, or to give
it jealousy, not to erect the Duke as head of a party,—he
talked in his usual vague and inconclusive manner;
his nearest friends having often said, that between the
uncommunicativeness of his temper and the want of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
suite in his reasoning faculties, it was ever impossible
to pin him down to any chain of definite propositions.</p>

<p>This the Duke experienced, and combated in vain.
All he could draw from Pitt was, a positive demand
that the peace should be opposed by the now forming
party. Yet would he not submit to see the Duke of
Newcastle; though, in his lofty style, he said he would
accept of the Duke of Cumberland’s guarantee of
Newcastle’s fidelity. It was difficult for the chiefs to
coalesce: Lord Hardwicke had publicly commended
the preliminaries; and though he had rejected large
offers made to his son, Charles Yorke, he and his
friends knew not decently how to fly to Mr. Pitt’s
banner, which they had so lately levelled. This want
of union in the Opposition gave all the remaining
advantage to the administration that they yet wanted.
Mr. Pitt affected to be a chief without a party, and
the party without him had no other chief; for Newcastle
was worse than none, and the Duke of Cumberland
had too much deference for the Crown, and was
too much above courting the people, to be fit to figure
as a ringleader.</p>

<p>In this temper of things did the Parliament meet
November 25th. Lord Egmont and Lord Weymouth<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>
moved the Address in the Lords, where there was
no opposition: Lord Carysfort<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> and Lord Charles
Spencer in the Commons. Nicholson Calvert made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
a warm speech against the peace, and was answered by
Birt, who gave Mr. Pitt the honour of the first plan
for taking Martinico. Beckford was yet more violent
against the treaty; and compared Florida, which was
to be ceded to us, for barrenness to Bagshot Heath.
Charles Townshend made a trimming speech, though
very personal against Beckford, and the day ended
without a division; Mr. Pitt being confined at home
with the gout. Without doors the scene was more
turbulent: the Favourite was assaulted in his chair by
a formidable mob, and had not the Guards arrived
opportunely, would hardly have escaped with life.</p>

<p>On the 30th of the month the preliminaries were
laid before both Houses, who were acquainted that the
King had ordered them to be printed and distributed
to the members on the morrow. The Duke of Grafton
in the Lords, Calvert and Bamber Gascoyne in the
Commons, objected to this; it being usual for the two
Houses to give the orders for printing papers communicated
to them; but the first method was acquiesced
in, and the Lords resolved to take the papers
into consideration on the Thursday sevennight following.
Lord Pomfret<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> moved to order the high bailiff
of Westminster to attend, to give an account why he
had taken no measures to disperse the mob on the first
day of the session. At the same time the ministers
endeavoured, by money and threats, to silence or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
intimidate the printers of newspapers, libels, and satiric
prints, and succeeded with a great number.</p>

<p>On the 1st of December, Calvert moved to defer
considering the preliminaries till the Thursday sevennight
following, as Mr. Pitt was not able to attend;
but the ministers, and for that very reason, insisted on
bringing them on upon the same day with the Lords,
and carried their motion by 213 to 74; so unpromising
was this outset of the new Opposition, in which
appeared the families of Cavendish, Fitzroy, and
Townshend.</p>

<p>The memorable day, December 9th, being arrived,
both Houses sat on the preliminaries. Lord Shelburne
and Lord Grosvenor moved to approve them. The
Duke of Grafton, with great weight and greater
warmth, attacked them severely, and, looking full on
Lord Bute, imputed to him corruption and worse arts.
The Duke was answered by the Earl of Suffolk; and
then Lord Temple spoke with less than usual warmth.
The Favourite rose next, and defended himself with
applause, having laid aside much of his former pomp.
He treated the Duke of Grafton as a juvenile member,
whose imputations he despised; and, for the Peace,
he desired to have written on his tomb, “Here lies
the Earl of Bute, who, in concert with the King’s
ministers, made the Peace.” A sentence often re-echoed
with the ridicule it deserved, and more likely
to be engraven on his monument with ignominy than
approbation. The Duke of Newcastle and Lord
Hardwicke censured the preliminaries, which the latter
said were worse than could have been obtained
the last year; and he reflected on the assiduity with
which prerogative was cried up, more than it had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
by the most ductile Parliaments. Henley the Chancellor
abused them both: but the fine defence of the
treaty was made by Lord Mansfield, which, he said,
though he had concurred to make, he should still
retain his old connections and attachments; a promise
he soon violated, with as little decency as his late
friends had censured prerogative. At ten at night
the preliminaries were approved by the Lords without
a division.</p>

<p>But it was the other House on which expectation
hung. The very uncertainty whether Mr. Pitt’s health
would allow him to attend, concurred to augment the
impatience of the public on so serious a crisis. The
Court, it was true, had purchased an effective number
of votes to ratify their treaty; but, could Mr. Pitt
appear, he might so expose the negotiation, and give
breath to such a flame, that the ministers could not
but be anxious till the day was decided, and they knew
all that they had to apprehend from Mr. Pitt. Their
hopes grew brighter as the debate began, and he did
not appear. The probability of his absence augmented
as Beckford proposed to refer the preliminaries to a
committee of the whole House; a measure that seemed
calculated to gain time, and that was seconded by
James Grenville, who told the courtiers that it did
not look as if they were very desirous of praise, so
eager were they to hurry through the question. The
demand was opposed by Ellis, Sir Francis Dashwood,
and Harris of Salisbury, when the House was alarmed
by a shout from without! The doors opened, and at
the head of a large acclaiming concourse was seen Mr.
Pitt, borne in the arms of his servants, who, setting
him down within the bar, he crawled by the help of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
crutch, and with the assistance of some few friends,
to his seat; not without the sneers of some of Fox’s
party. In truth, there was a mixture of the very
solemn and the theatric in this apparition. The moment
was so well timed, the importance of the man
and his services, the languor of his emaciated countenance,
and the study bestowed on his dress, were
circumstances that struck solemnity into a patriot
mind, and did a little furnish ridicule to the hardened
and insensible. He was dressed in black velvet, his
legs and thighs wrapped in flannel, his feet covered
with buskins of black cloth, and his hands with thick
gloves. He said a few words in support of the motion
for sending the preliminaries to a committee; not in
order to give time for raising animosities, but as it was
for the dignity of the King and the country to weigh
them maturely. Parts of the treaty, he confessed
were, beyond his expectation, good; but his mind was
wounded by what regarded our trade and our allies.
He wished for a committee, that he might call merchants
to the bar to state the importance of what we
were to keep, of what we were to give away. He
would be convinced we were doing right, or he would
<em>inflexibly arraign</em>. Legge said, he should cavil less than
most men, but could not bestow approbation in the
lump. Fox answered as briefly, that nothing could
ever be finished, if perfection was insisted on. Beckford
replied, that the House was as insignificant as a
parliament of Paris, if treaties were not laid before
them for advice, but only for approbation; and he and
Calvert laid themselves out on the defence made by
the ministers, that it was the King’s prerogative to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
conclude peace or war; and, indeed, no occasion was
lost of sounding high any branch of prerogative.</p>

<p>The Opposition not choosing to risk a division on the
Committee, Harris, mentioned above, who was afterwards
made one of the Lords of the Treasury, moved
roundly to approve the preliminaries, with the addition
of words acknowledging the prerogative in
question. Had the treaty been glorious or salutary,
there is no doubt but the prerogative would not have
been called in aid; a proof how distinct are prerogative
and the welfare of the nation. This Harris had
written some abstruse books on language, and possessed
a good share of reputation within a certain
sphere. Lord Ilchester and Fox had brought him
forth, and thought to make him a man of business,
but he made only a very pliant courtier and wretched
orator; and in the end, attaching himself to George
Grenville, closed with all his arbitrary measures, and
fell with him, with no other blemish on his character
than of having thought too much as a scholar, and too
little as a senator.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> In his motion of approbation he
said, “Peace was not made for the emolument of one
country, but of many;” a truth so home, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
recoiled so forcibly on him, that it was the very reason
why this country, for whose emolument it was <em>not</em>
made, ought not to have honoured it with its acceptance.</p>

<p>Stanley spoke well and handsomely in defence of
the treaty; and then Mr. Pitt rose. His speech it
would be difficult to detail; it lasted three hours and
twenty-five minutes, and was uttered in so low and
faint a voice that it was almost impossible to hear
him. At intervals he obtained the permission of the
House to speak sitting, a permission he did not abuse;
supporting himself with cordials, and having the appearance
of a man determined to die in that cause
and at that hour. This faintness and the prolixity
with which he dwelt on the article of the fisheries,
gave a handle to the courtiers to represent his speech
as unmeasurably dull, tedious, and uninteresting. But
it contained considerable matter, much reason, and
some parts of great beauty:—but thunder was wanting
to blast such a treaty, and this was not a day on
which his genius thundered! His health or his choice
had led him to present himself as a subject of affliction
to his country, and his ungrateful country was not
afflicted.</p>

<p>Some passages of his speech I shall mention,
though, for the reasons I have hinted at, and for
that I sat at a great distance, I could but very imperfectly
collect what he said. He allowed the
prerogative of the Crown in making peace or war,
though something he saw squint at what would
subvert the liberties of this country; and, although
such prerogative there was, still was it gracious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
to lay the Treaty before Parliament. The Crown
might finally sign the Treaty; but at the same
time it was a fundamental right of the House of
Commons to offer their opinion. If this was not the
question confessed, he would stop the debate to insert
in these words, <em>as it is also the indubitable and fundamental
right of Parliament to offer advice</em>. From this
he launched out on <em>this venerable, this lovely Constitution</em>,
and referred to the journals to show what
answers were made by Parliament to James the
First and Charles the Second; particularly to the
unkingly and unconstitutional messages of the former,
as when he bade them not meddle beyond their
province, with a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ne sutor ultra crepidam</i>. He hoped
we had no new cobbler of this old Constitution,
and (looking at Fox) if we had, that man should
not stand unaccused, unarraigned. With regard to
the peace, it could not be called a question of
humanity, for one campaign more might have prevented
seven hereafter. In all other wars our commerce
had been interrupted; in this alone, increased;
and in respect of commerce, four of the best provinces
in old France were not worth the acquisitions
we had made. Those France might have reconquered;
Guadaloupe she could not retake. We
had got possession of their four trades of the world.
Thanks to God, General Amherst had recovered
Newfoundland! Thanks to Providence, Amherst’s
brother had behaved like <em>his</em> brother! Thus had we
secured two of those trades, the fisheries and the
sugar, all but at St. Domingo, and that we must have
taken the next campaign. Our conquests in Africa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
gave us the Slave Trade; and those in India the
exclusive trade of the Indies. <em>These depended no
longer on the chance of war!</em> He believed there was
no disunion between France and Spain; this treaty
would manifestly increase their weight: the Havannah
would add to it—the Havannah! that would have
enabled you to supply Spanish America with British
manufactures and implements! He then pronounced
the preliminaries <em>inadmissible</em>; declared he had
thought it right to make peace when Mr. Stanley
went to France, and had been for the King not
abusing his prosperity. But he had <em>proved</em> that
France was not in earnest <em>then</em>; had only meant
to cajole us, and deserved no management from us,
after forcing us to the expense of this war, particularly
by her iniquitous behaviour in the two
Courts of Madrid and Naples, a conduct never paralleled
in the unbridled behaviour of Louis the
Fourteenth. Yet why talk of Naples, which was
Bourbon weakness coupled with Bourbon weakness!
Obstinate, however, as himself had been in pushing
forward the war with Spain, he supposed he had
been in the wrong, as nobody had joined in sentiment
with him but Lord Temple. They two were
for making the entire maintenance of the fisheries
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine quâ non</i>; but all the rest had been against
them, both the old Ministers and <em>the favoured
Minister of this King</em>. Soon had it been known to
France that the exclusive fisheries would not be
made a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine quâ non</i>. He had not thought that
France would at once give them up, but he had held
them worth trying for for another campaign or two.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
Before the death of the Czarina—before the acquisition
of Guadaloupe, the Havannah, and Pondicherry,
the Duc de Choiseul had asked but for one rock
at Newfoundland; he wished he had made his stand
there, and refused, though overwhelmed with most
illiberal calumny and scurrility! He took notice
of the thousands of lives thrown away at the Havannah
by their being sent out at so untimely a
season, when the work might have been done in
the month of April; but he had retired first, when
he found he was not permitted to have the least
weight. Yes, said he again, the French had cried
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Donnez nous un rocher simplement</i>.—I replied, I did
not intend to give them the garden of Eden. But
what they asked for their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">batiments pêcheurs</i> extended
to much more than a rock. They asked
for fishing vessels, now had been given them a
fishery—<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en toute propriété</i>, in full right; I never
would have granted it. Then, after expatiating
on the fisheries, he drew attention to himself, by
seeming to bid adieu to politics, and to despair of
his own health. He might never come to the House
again. He was unconnected, followed no party, respected
the King’s administration, though he must
remonstrate when he saw them going on fatal ground.
He prayed for the House of Brunswick; stood on revolution
principles alone against France; had a deep-rooted
alienation from France; acted on the spirit
of King William, on whose maxims, and on the
maxims on which they came thither, the House of
Brunswick must rest, or could never be secure.
He had seen the day on which every unsound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
maxim had been disclaimed; now saw unhappy clouds
darkening our prospect; wished the Ministers would
think of these important matters before it was too
late!</p>

<p>He then went through the points to be ceded in
America and Africa; and declared he would not have
agreed to any terms approaching to these preliminaries.
He inveighed against the bad faith of France, and
showed from their losses how much they had lain at
our mercy. In the campaign of Crevelt alone they
had lost forty thousand men. Every year had cost
them twenty thousand more. Would you still treat
on the same terms you would have treated, after they
had put you to the expense of fourteen additional millions,
and after your arms had been crowned with such
advantages? It could not be for the sake of Portugal;
for you had been told from the throne that a stop had
been put to the progress of the Spaniards in that
country. We must, say the French, have St. Lucia,
for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cela bouche Martinique</i>; is that a reason to be
given to a British Parliament? France should have
given you Guadaloupe, or she and Spain, Hispaniola.
She had given you more in Canada than she knew
you could use, and more than he had contended for;
but then she had got the fisheries. On the coast of
Bengal we should never have suffered her to come;
yet did she affect to cede all her conquests, where she
had made <em>none</em>; but, alas! no nation had ever lost an
opportunity so happy, so almost accomplished, of fixing
its ascendant and commerce! He applauded the
drawing of the article of Canada, infinitely better
executed than he could have done it. Spain, too, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
owned, had acknowledged our right of cutting log-wood
as fully as he could find any authority in our
records to contend for; but the negotiators had not
been equally able, in fixing Spain, to acknowledge our
right of fishery in Newfoundland. Spain does not
renounce her right of fishing there, but desists. For
the King of Prussia he was disavowed! given up!
sacrificed! so melancholy was the effect of the coldness
that was grown between the two crowns! The
branches of Bourbon were united; we and our allies
disunited! He had seen nothing he envied in French
councils till now. They had indulged a noble delicacy
of honour, and obtained everything for Spain; nay,
had treated Austria with punctilio. We did not so
remember those who had served us! The moment the
battle of Culloden should be forgotten, this country
would be undone! We ought to have made a family
compact with the King of Prussia.</p>

<p>Stanley said a few words on his own part in the
negotiation; and then Mr. Fox rising to speak, Pitt,
in contempt or exhausted, retired out of the house,
attended by redoubled huzzas! the mob re-echoing
the duration of his speech, “Three hours and a half!
three hours and a half!”</p>

<p>The secession of Pitt struck such a damp on Opposition,
that Fox had but little to do but to chant <cite>Te
Deum</cite> for victory. He said little, very little, in behalf
of the treaty, to which success was now ensured. He
rather painted his own situation, and that of parties,
ranking himself with the Whigs, but affecting to
believe a general union of all factions under the King.
He had been called out, he said, when men would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
have revived those distinctions, and torn the Tories
from the support of the Crown. No desire did he
know of extending prerogative; if it had been exerted
unduly in signing the preliminaries, Ministers were
answerable; but he vowed to God he did not know
that it was in the mind of any man to enlarge
the prerogative. Mr. Pitt had thought we could
have gone on much longer, and that France could
not; he himself thought we could not have gone on
much longer: but what had Mr. Pitt given, except
assertions in support of his persuasion? He himself
had been told that our commerce was declined.
If England would apply itself to improve this peace,
it would turn out the greatest that ever had been
made.</p>

<p>Charles Townshend, discontent, expecting much
severe animadversion on the treaty, and dreading to
differ with Mr. Pitt when the latter was likely to
exert all his powers, had come to the House prepared
to arraign the preliminaries. Finding his mistake, and
secure by the retreat of Pitt, he changed his battery,
defended the peace as well as it could be defended,
burned incense on the altar of prerogative, and sang
almost hosannahs to the praise of the King. It happened
the next day that Dempster, commending Mr.
Pitt, and calling him the <em>arch-patriot</em>, Rigby said, Mr.
Pitt, it was true, had spoken three hours and a half,
but an <em>archer-patriot</em> had said more to the purpose in
twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>The Duke of Newcastle had sent to his friends not
to divide; on which they retired. This not being
known to the Duke of Cumberland, his adherents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
stayed, and two of his own servants, Lord Ancram<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> and
General Fitzwilliam,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> were in the minority—which
were but sixty-five against three hundred and nineteen.
The Duke was angry that his people had been
left alone: on which it was resolved to rally on the
Report, but with no better success; the Court were
still two hundred and twenty-seven to sixty-three,
Lord Royston, Lord Hardwicke’s son, being of the
majority.</p>

<p>Nothing can paint the importance of this victory to
the Court so strongly as what the Princess of Wales
said, on the news of the preliminaries being carried:
“Now,” said she, “my son <em>is</em> King of England.” The
ministers ordered that the numbers on the question
should be printed—had they printed the names too,
the world would have known the names of the sixty-five
that were <em>not</em> bribed.</p>

<p>Fox having thus successfully employed rewards,
thought the time was come for making use of the
other weapon of government—punishment. A more
severe political persecution never raged. Whoever,
holding a place, had voted against the preliminaries,
was instantly dismissed. The friends<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> and dependents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
of the Duke of Newcastle were particularly cashiered;
and this cruelty was extended so far, that old servants,
who had retired and been preferred to very small
places, were rigorously hunted out and deprived of
their livelihood. An inquisition was held at Fox’s
house; and a despotic spirit prevailed so rudely, that
Lady Elizabeth Waldegrave,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> sister of the Duchess
of Bedford, and a notable politician, desired to be admitted
to the junto of proscription.</p>

<p>In particular, Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Earle<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> were
dismissed from the Board of Ordnance for their votes;
as was the younger Thomas Townshend<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> from the
green cloth, without the smallest notification. Some
were even sacrificed who had given no offence, as the
worthy Admiral Forbes,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> who was removed from the
Admiralty to make room for Cotes, of the same profession
and a friend of Fox. Schutz, who had been
seven years of the King’s bedchamber, was turned out,
for no reason but that he had not a seat in Parliament,
and could be of no use there.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
But to wind up the year with more dignified rigour,
the Dukes of Newcastle and Grafton and the Marquis
of Rockingham were dismissed from the Lieutenancies
of their several counties.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> The same affront being
designed for the Duke of Devonshire, Fox affected to
make a point of saving him; but the Duke, with proper
spirit, scorned to be obliged to him, and resigned
to accompany his friends.</p>

<p>John Earl Granville, the antagonist of one
Prime Minister, Prime Minister himself, and then
assistant to every succeeding Prime Minister, died on
the second day of the new year. The rhodomontade,
to which he was addicted, was set off by parts and
wit, or forgiven to his good-humour. It was very
unlike the presumptuous ascendant of Pitt, or the
lofty ignorance of Lord Bute. Pitt, unsociable and
muffled in clouds, was adored from the terror imprinted
by his lightnings. Bute thought distance and
obscurity sufficient characteristics of divinity; but
Granville, like Bacchus, rattled his car among men,
and was but the more admired the more he familiarized
himself with mortals. He had fallen unpitied,
but unhated; and sank in rank without sinking in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
esteem, his fall having lessened him less than his
exaltation. He seemed so proper for every part, that
in him it did not seem mean to be second, after commanding.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>The persecution, set on foot at the end of the last
year, was kept up with unrelaxed severity.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> A place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
of 200<i>l.</i> a year was taken from Mr. Legge’s nephew,<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a>
a boy at school: and another of the same value from
a man in Sussex, who had been rewarded with it for
service done against an inhuman set of smugglers, by
the interest of the late Duke of Grafton, whom Fox
had hated. In truth, these hardships were not only
suggested by Fox, but now and then executed without
the knowledge of the Favourite, who often disclaimed<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>
them, and sometimes, to load his associate, made recompense
to the parties aggrieved; for though they
became heartier friends afterwards, and though the
Favourite bore testimony, in a subsequent period, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Fox was the only man who had not deceived him, it is
pretty sure that their ministerial league was far from
cordial; not quite sure that Bute did not deceive Fox;
and certain, that the King betrayed symptoms of satisfaction
on hearing that the blame of all this violence
fell on Fox.</p>

<p>He had meditated going still greater lengths. Lord
Lincoln, whom he particularly hated, was Auditor of
the Exchequer for life, the amplest sinecure in England,
except the Archbishoprick of Canterbury. Some
other great patent-places were held by men then in
Opposition. Fox himself enjoyed a very considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
one in Ireland; yet so much did his thirst of vengeance
surmount his interest, that a question was put
to the Chancellor, whether the King could not take
away patents bestowed in former reigns, and whether
the case might not be laid before the twelve Judges.
The Chancellor, who had fits of bluntness and honesty,
or prophetically affectionate to grants for life, so profusely
heaped on him afterwards, replied, “Yes, they
might lay the idea before the Judges, and then refer
Magna Charta to them afterwards, to decide on that
too.” Norton, Solicitor-General, as bold and as blunt,
but never as honest as Lord Northington, being consulted
to the same point, advised to take away the
places, and then see if the law would restore them.
This man now rose from obscure infamy to that infamous
fame which long will stick to him. It was
known that in private causes he took money from
both parties, and availed himself against one or other
of them of the lights they had communicated to him.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
Yet his abilities were so good, and his knowledge so
great, that no man had more extensive practice in
Westminster Hall. In Parliament he had for some
years been disregarded; but his foul tongue and
causidical boldness, his clearness in argument or facility
in assertion, his attachment to Lord Mansfield,
and his total alienation from all principle, offered him
as a proper tool to a Court that was to wade through
the letter of the law to the demolition of the spirit.
Yet his authority alone could not encourage such a
violation of justice as had now been in agitation. The
Favourite, too, and the Favourite’s favourites, might
think it more eligible to leave patent places unmolested;
they must have coveted them more than they
could wish, to render them precarious.</p>

<p>The Duke of Cumberland, on these harsh proceedings,
said to Lord Waldegrave, “Fox has deceived
me grossly—not, as you think, by giving me up; he
might be as angry with me for talking to Newcastle
and Pitt—but he has deceived me, for I thought him
good-natured; but in all these transactions he has shown
the bitterest revenge and inhumanity.”</p>

<p>When the Houses met after Christmas, the Court
was so thoroughly the master, that scarce an attempt
was made at opposition. Yet Wilkes and Churchill
wrote with as much intemperance as if the nation had
been overspread with the flame of faction. The latter
now published his “Prophecy of Famine,” one of the
severest and least irregular of his works. Their poems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
and libels seemed to have little effect, but the seeds
sown by them took deep root. Nor did the Court
trouble itself to deny what was charged on it. The
measures of the House of Stuart were so thoroughly
copied, that even the rankest friends of that family
were adopted at St. James’s. Sir John Philipps himself
was made a privy councillor.</p>

<p>It happened that Lord Strange,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> moving a common
adjournment to the following Monday, the Speaker
said the House must adjourn till Tuesday, for Monday
would be the 30th of January. Lord Strange laughed
at such a Saint’s day, and divided the House, but
found only thirty-six persons of his opinion; one hundred
and three were for observing the ridiculous fast.
Fox was of the majority, who, very few years before,
had been for putting an end to that Jacobite holiday—a
clear indication of the principles of the new Court.
Lord Strange causing that part of the act of Parliament,
which ordains observance of the day, to be read,
and affirming that the words <em>Neither Parliament nor
People can judge the King</em>, were contrary to the constitution;
Fox denied it, and maintained that the constitution
had always held that language. Rose Fuller
and Lord Strange moved another day, to abolish the
observation of the pretended martyrdom, but it was
overruled by the House: however, it produced a very
bold and extraordinary speech from Calvert; he drew
a picture of a fictitious family in Surrey, whom he
called <em>the Steadys</em>, describing two old Steadys and a
young one; with a very particular account of young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
Steady’s mother, and of her improper intimacy with a
Scotch gardener—he hoped the true friends of young
<em>Steady</em> would advise him to recall his old friends, and
turn away the Scotch gardener. No reply was made,
for none could be made, without carrying the application
too home.</p>

<p>Most of the other transactions of this session were
as trifling, and deserve but little notice. Sir John
Philipps, to preserve a semblance of patriotism, or instigated
by Bute to intimidate Newcastle, moved for
the accounts of the nation. Fox, who did not like
any clue that might lead to the mysteries of the Pay-Office,
opposed it; and Lord Granby, though sold to
the Court, warmly defended the Duke of Newcastle’s
integrity. Legge objected, too, and said he saw no
end such a motion tended to; it was like asking a
country fellow the way—he always asks you whence
you came! Aislabie<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> reflected on Fox for not passing
his accounts, and the attack was received with loud
marks of approbation; but when neither the late nor
actual ministers encouraged the inquiry, it was not
likely to be very successful. Sir John Philipps accordingly
desisted, and Sir Francis Dashwood proposed to
name a select committee to examine any accounts
that had been brought in, which was agreed to; and
lists were given out, from whence an equal number
being chosen of the Court’s and of Newcastle’s friends,
no more came of this, than of twenty such intended
inquiries. Nor was anything memorable in the outset,
but that the Tories, meeting in a body to consider the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
proposed lists, erased the names of Fox’s four chief
friends; still, so blind were those dull men to their
real interest, and still so much addicted to be led by
mere names, they even objected to the large army
proposed to be maintained; proof that they had not
one sensible man of their body. What should a large
army achieve but the work of monarchy? Or say the
Tories were honest men and lovers of liberty? Could
they love liberty and slavery both? or did they call
themselves by a disgraceful name when they deserved
to wear an honourable one? In truth, all the sensible
Tories I ever knew were either Jacobites or became
Whigs; those that remained Tories remained fools.</p>

<p>A scheme more laudable, more necessary, and founded
on a crying evil, met with no fairer success than the
committee of accounts. I mean the committee to
inspect and redress the grievous abuses of madhouses.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a>
Charles Townshend took great pains in that business,
distinguished himself, was content and dropped it.
The lawyers raised many objections, and removed none.
Poor humanity! how ill art thou treated by the human
race! We fire at the relation of calamities, denounce
vengeance on the perpetrators, cry out for, set about,
reformation, and in England, give us our due, lavish
our money towards it; then grow cool, and never
think of the woe afterwards. Lawyers never suffer
correction of abuses; they defend them even where
they do not commit them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
When the accounts of the navy were brought into
the House, it appeared that one hundred and eighty-four
thousand seamen had been raised during the war.
Of these, one hundred and thirty thousand had been
lost to the nation; and yet, scarce will it be believed,
sixteen hundred only had been killed!<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Many had
deserted, and had enlisted again; others went into
other services. Most of the rest died of distempers,
climates, hardships, &amp;c. But with the loss of sixteen
hundred men, we had destroyed the navies of France
and Spain. Glorious consideration! could it be unmixed
with the remembrance of the other hundred
and twenty-eight thousand! But Glory must shed
more tears of anguish than of joy, whenever she turns
accomptant. What if returns were made of all the
other lives lost in that war all over the face of the
globe! What did the peasants in Germany suffer?
even heroism had its pangs. Did not the King of
Prussia see every general with whom he commenced
that short war perish before his eyes? I said he felt a
pang—I hope he did. It is an observation a little
foreign to the reflection with which I set out, but
extensively victorious as that war was to Britain,
she did not see one famous <em>native</em> general arise out of
that war, except Wolfe, who died in the cradle of his
celebrity; and unless we name Lord Clive, who was
more a statesman than general, and in both respects
not matched against equal rivals. I do not mean to
detract from his merits; he was born to shine in the
Indies: at home he never stepped beyond the common
of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Charles Townshend, who had but just resigned,
and who had no sooner resigned than he opposed
the opposition, perceiving the weakness of that opposition,
that Pitt would not lead it, and afraid to
lead it himself, struck in again with the tide, and
at the end of February kissed hands for first Lord
of Trade, with a nominal rank of Cabinet Councillor,
but without being permitted to go in to the King with
state papers, except with those relating to the Board
of Trade. He had boasted of far greater offers. Lord
Sandys was removed to make room for him. A promiscuous
meeting being held at Sir Francis Dashwood’s,
to consider what proportion of army should be kept up,
Ellis, Secretary at War, proposed eighteen thousand
men for England, ten for America, and the usual twelve
thousand for Ireland; but hinted at raising six thousand
more for the latter kingdom; which Fox said the
King desired. Sir Charles Mordaunt, a chief Tory,
said he had great duty for the King, but could not
consent to that augmentation. Charles Townshend
seconded his refusal, and it was given up.</p>

<p>Lord Strange said the King must know what
force was wanting, and if necessary it must be
granted; but if the King would give it up, it showed
it was not necessary; and therefore himself should
be for the lesser number. Sir John Philipps, Lord
George Sackville, and Rigby tried in Parliament to
obtain the additional six thousand, but could not
carry the point, though they endeavoured to prove
that the King was not limited by the act of King
William to but twelve thousand men in Ireland.</p>

<p>When the day came for voting the army, Mr. Pitt
attended. He approved the measure, he said, as far as
it went, but wished more troops were allotted to America.
That he had a very different opinion from many
of the peace: thought it hollow and insecure, <em>and that it
would not last ten years</em>. He showed no acrimony
to Fox, he and Lord Temple both seeming more
hostile to Lord Bute; but he dropped, that if any
body would point out the right way to inquire what
was the cause of so many dismissions, he would second
the motion. Beckford having wished the army more
reduced, Pitt said, such reductions had hurt us formerly.
After the peace of Ryswick the army was
lessened to seven thousand; but war followed in three
years. After the treaty of Utrecht, but eight thousand
men were kept up, but that reduction produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
a rebellion and an army of fifteen thousand. Charles
Townshend, dreading the lash of Pitt on his late
inconsistencies, retired early in the debate; but the
General, his brother, just arrived from Portugal,
was lavish in encomiums on the peace and peacemakers.</p>

<p>In a few days after, Beckford, seconded by Pitt,
moved to address the King to prefer officers on half-pay
to those whose commissions were fresher; and
though Fox and the ministers objected, it was suffered
to pass. Sir Henry Erskine in the course of the
debate frequently sounding the King’s name, Mr. Pitt
severely reprimanded the Speaker for not stopping
him.</p>

<p>In the progress of these debates, it was observed,
that at least the Favourite’s faction, if not himself,
were hostile to Fox. On the committee of
accounts, Elliot and Lord North had been so personal
to him, that he lost his temper; and Beckford
desiring him to save appearances, he replied,
he never minded appearances, but—he was going
to say, realities, when a loud burst of laughter from
the whole House interrupted him. His rage was
so great, that, sitting down, he said to Onslow,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a>
though an enemy, “Did you ever see a man so
treated in my situation? but, by G—, I will have
an explanation and ample submission, or I will never
set my foot in this House again.” Another symptom
of disunion was, that Lord Ravensworth<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> having
moved for the whole accounts of the war, Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Hardwicke said it was impossible to produce them
yet; the paymaster had a deputy abroad who could
not have made them up. This being understood as a
reflection on Fox, Lord Hardwicke said, on the contrary,
he had meant to vindicate him. Lord Talbot
concurred with this explanation; adding, “Nobody
can imagine that <em>I</em> want to screen Mr. Fox;” an expression
warmly taken up by Lord Hilsborough, one
of Fox’s friends.</p>

<p>If Lord Bute countenanced these hostilities, it was
but consonant to the folly of his character. Fox had
boldness and wickedness enough to undertake whatever
the Court wished to compass. Fox seemed so
apprehensive of treachery, that he cast about to
recover his old connections. By Lord Albemarle,
Lord Frederick Cavendish,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> and Lord Waldegrave,
he laboured to be reconciled to the Duke of Cumberland
and the Duke of Devonshire. He asked
Lord Waldegrave if the former was still incensed
against him. The other replied, he had not heard
the Duke mention him of late, but supposed his
Royal Highness could not be ignorant how much he
had been abused by Murphy, known to write under
Fox’s direction. “Formerly he did so,” said Fox,
“but I had not seen him in a year and a half, till
<em>hearing</em> how violent the ‘Auditors’ were, I sent for
him and stopped them;”—an excuse too weak <em>for</em> a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
sensible man to make <em>to</em> a sensible man <em>through</em> a
sensible man. Lord Waldegrave suspected that Fox’s
views went deeper than reconciliation; for shortly
after this conversation Rigby came to the Earl, and
sounded him whether he would not take the Treasury,
Lord Bute, he said, not being able to stand his ground.
As Lord Waldegrave had married my niece,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> I knew
all these intrigues from him, and was actually in his
house at the time of this overture, of which he immediately
told me with an expressive smile, which in
him, who never uttered a bitter word, conveyed the
essence of sense and satire.</p>

<p>We must now quit Fox, to make room for a doughty
hero of more comic cast, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a>
Hitherto he had but just acted enough as
minister, to show that he neither was one nor was fit
to be one. The time was now come for <em>opening the
budget</em>, when it was incumbent on him to state the
finances, debts, and calls of Government; and to chalk
out a plan of proper supplies. All this he performed
so awkwardly, with so little intelligence or clearness,
in so vulgar a tone, and in such mean language, that
he, who had been esteemed a plain country gentleman
of good sense, said himself afterwards, “People will
point at me, and cry, <em>there goes the worst Chancellor of
the Exchequer that ever appeared</em>!” His famous measure
was the tax on cider; and whoever would know
more of his ability in conducting that business, will
find it amply detailed in the North-Britons; a coarse
and satiric picture, yet but little exaggerated. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
tax itself deserves far more than the author of it to
live in the memory of English history, for the crisis it
occasioned or drove on.</p>

<p>In the discussion of these ways and means, George
Grenville complained that men objected to laying burthens
on the sinking fund, and called rather for new
taxes. He wished gentlemen would show him <em>where</em>
to lay them. Repeating this question in his querulous,
languid, fatiguing tone, Pitt, who sat opposite to him,
mimicking his accent aloud, repeated these words of
an old ditty—<em>Gentle shepherd, tell me where!</em> and then
rising, abused Grenville bitterly. He had no sooner
finished than Grenville started up in a transport of
rage, and said, if gentlemen were to be treated with
that contempt—Pitt was walking out of the House,
but at that word turned round, made a sneering bow
to Grenville and departed. The latter had provoked
him by stating the profusions of the war. There is
use in recording this anecdote: the appellation of
<em>The Gentle Shepherd</em> long stuck by Grenville; he is
mentioned by it in many of the writings on the stamp
act, and in other pamphlets and political prints of the
time.</p>

<p>The tax on cider raised a great flame in the western
counties, and by management, that flame was transported
to the metropolis. All the western members,
however, attached to the Court, could not avoid defending
the interests of their constituents; and thus
joining what standing Opposition there was, the minority
often divided near 120: and as every step
of the bill was ardently fought, divisions happened
frequently, and threw a kind of vivacity into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
session. In the city Sir William Baker acted strenuously
against the Court, and Wilkes’s pen was never
idle.</p>

<p>In the meantime Fox received another humiliation.
He had received a petition for relief from the sufferers
at Newfoundland. It was objected to from all quarters
of the House: general indemnification could not
be made to all the sufferers by the war, why then
partial? Sir Francis Dashwood, Lord Barrington, and
Nugent supported Fox faintly; Ellis and Rigby
warmly; Lord George Sackville with panegyric, for
which he was reproved by Lord Strange, who, with
G. Grenville, Stanley, and Lord Frederick Campbell,
treated Fox and his petition harshly. During this
altercation Lord Middleton, casting his eye over the
paper, observed that all the names to the petition were
signed by the same hand. This occasioned such an
uproar, that Fox was obliged to ask pardon, and withdraw
the petition, pleading, that the paper had been
written out fair from the original, which had really
been signed by the petitioners. In private, he said
that there had been a paragraph not worded with sufficient
respect to the House, which occasioned his
having the petition copied out by a clerk, and there
had not been time to get it signed again; but he stood
so ill in the public eye, that whatever he did received
the worst construction.</p>

<p>March 28th. The Cider-bill had now laboured
through the Commons, and was read for the second
time by the Lords. Lord Hardwicke spoke and voted
against it; but was answered well, and with severity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
by Lord Marchmont.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> Lord Mansfield made a bad
trimming speech, but voted for the bill. Lord Lyttelton<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>
spoke well against it. Lord Pomfret heaped
panegyrics on the Favourite, whose own speech was
languid and unargumentative. The Tory Lords who
belong chiefly to the western counties were most of
them against the bill, as were nine of the Bishops;
but the bill was committed by a majority of 71 to 39.</p>

<p>It was read the third time on the 30th, and was
attacked with energy by the Duke of Grafton; by
Lord Dartmouth<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> with decency and propriety; by
Lord Lyttelton, though with censures on the political
pamphlets of the time; and by the Duke of Newcastle,
who complimented the rising generation. It
having been reported that, on hearing the City would
petition the King against the bill, as they had both
Houses, on the ground of the bill being calculated to
extend the excise, Lord Bute had sent word to the
leading men of the City, that if they would drop their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
petition, the bill should be repealed the next session,
he thought it necessary to explain the foundation of
that report; he had only sent word, he said, that if
the bill proved a bad one, which he did not believe
it would, he would try to get it repealed. This was
one of his best speeches, though not divested of pomp,
and with much affected contempt of popularity. Lord
Ravensworth expressed great scorn of the City assuming
the dictatorial tone. Lord Denbigh was still more
bitter, and spoke with so much wit and applause that
in very few days he was made a Lord of the Bedchamber.
Lord Temple having in both debates been very
personal to the Favourite, and having declared in
favour of excise, as Lord Bute had against it, Lord
Denbigh said he hoped the King, to please the City,
would remove the Minister who was against excise,
and place that Lord who was for it at the head of
the Treasury. The bill was passed, sixty-two lords
being for it, thirty-eight against it. After the first
debate, the Lords Oxford, Foley, and Willoughby protested;
the first and last of the King’s bedchamber.
After the second debate, the Duke of Bolton,<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> Earl
Temple, and Lord Fortescue protested.</p>

<p>Immediately after the House rose the Sheriffs hurried
to St. James’s; and, though at so unusual an hour,
and without having previously asked leave, presented
to the King a petition not to pass the bill; but he
passed it the very next morning.</p>

<p>Few political clouds seemed less big with mischief
than this storm, unnaturally conjured up, and little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
likely to last; for what principle of union could there
be in common between the City of London and two
or three distant counties whose apples were to be
taxed? The spell, <em>excise</em>, was pronounced, but had
lost its terrors. They who sounded loudest the alarm,
neither were alarmed, nor expected to breathe much
dread into others. But there was a frame of nerves
more easily thrown into disorder; fear seized on
the Favourite; he said, “We shall have thirty thousand
men come down to St. James’s!” The assault
that had been made on him the first day of the
session had left a lasting impression; and he had
showed, early in the reign, that fortitude was not a
ruling ingredient in his composition. He had appointed
himself a guard of bruisers the day of his
attending the King into the City in 1761, when Mr.
Pitt made his insolent parade thither at the same
time. Now, bating the slight distemperature occasioned
by the cider-tax, England seemed to be willingly,
and submissively, prostrate at the Favourite’s
feet. Would she have rebelled for a partial tax, after
acquiescing in the peace? Fear does not calculate,
but lumps apprehensions in the gross. The panic
was taken, and on the 7th of April, to the surprise
of mankind, it was notified that Lord Bute
intended to resign the next day, and to retire for his
health, not being able to go through the fatigue of
business.</p>

<p>It is true, that he had at times declared, that
as soon as he had made the peace, he would quit
his post; but few had heard the declaration, and
fewer believed it. The Ministers knew nothing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
his intention till the day before it was publicly
notified; and Fox was so entirely out of the secret,
that he reproached the Earl bitterly for leaving
him in that ignorance and dilemma. The Favourite’s
own speeches in Parliament expressing a wish of
retirement had rather confirmed men in the opinion
that he had no thoughts of it. No one act had
had the least air of his giving up his power, nor
had any measures been taken to replace him or carry
on the present system; but the best comment on
his behaviour at that moment was his subsequent
conduct. The fondness he retained for power, his
intrigues to preserve it, the confusion he helped
to throw into almost every succeeding system,
and his impotent and dark attempts to hang on
the wheels of Government, which he only clogged,
and to which he dreaded even being suspected of
recommending drivers, all proved that neither virtue
nor philosophy had the honour of dictating his retreat;
but that fear, and fear only, was the immediate,
inconsiderate, and precipitate cause of his resignation.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<p>Yet let me not be thought to lament this
weak man’s pusillanimity. I am condemning his
want of policy, but rejoice at it. Had he been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
firm to himself, there was an end of the constitution!
The hearts of Englishmen were corrupt
and sold, and the best heads amongst them toiled
in the cause of Despotism. A happy panic blew
up the system of absolute power when it had lasted
but five months; and a trifling Opposition overturned
in a fortnight the work of that majority which
a fortnight had purchased. Yet the struggle was not
over. The rod fell into abler and more resolute
hands; the mercenaries were not disbanded, though
the commander-in-chief ran away. Fortunately he
became incompatible with his successors; and liberty
owed its salvation, not to its friends, but to discord
among the conspirators.</p>

<p>I have mentioned how utterly Fox was disconcerted
at this unexpected resignation. His first movement
was to press Lord Bute to retain the Treasury, at least
for six months. That attempt was fruitless. His
next step was to secure his own peerage. Again was
he astonished to be told that he had agreed to cede
the Pay-office on going into the House of Lords. This
he peremptorily denied. But he had dealt with a
worthy pupil of his own. Lord Shelburne, who had
negotiated between him and Lord Bute, when Fox
undertook the conduct of the House of Commons,
had told the Earl that Fox would quit the Pay-office
for a peerage; but Fox had only stipulated to give
his support for that reward. He now broke out against
his scholar, reproached him for concealing Lord Bute’s
intention of retiring, and spoke of Shelburne to everybody
<em>as a perfidious and infamous liar</em>; those were his
usual words. The probability was, that Shelburne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
intended to slip into the Pay-office himself. The
Favourite, who would have declared Fox his successor,
excused Lord Shelburne to him, and, in his pedantic
style, called the secrecy he had observed <em>a pious fraud</em>;
for Fox, he said, he knew would not have engaged in
the management of the Parliament, had he been apprized
that he (Bute) intended to retire, and it had
been necessary to the King’s affairs that Fox should
carry them through the session. This very offer of
the Treasury to Fox showed how little the Favourite
had taken any measures for carrying on his master’s
business for the future, and corroborates the presumption
that a sudden panic was the immediate cause of
his retreat.</p>

<p>Fox refusing to accept them, the post of First Lord
of the Treasury and the Seals of Chancellor of the
Exchequer were, on April 8, the very day on which
the Favourite resigned, bestowed on George Grenville.
Sir Francis Dashwood was removed to the Great
Wardrobe; and the barony of Despencer, then in
abeyance between him and his nephew, Sir Thomas
Stapleton, was granted to him: the one to repair, the
other to decorate his fall.</p>

<p>Some other promotions were made of the Favourite’s
and Fox’s adherents; and, to strengthen the new system,
many favours were heaped on the Duke of Bedford’s
dependents. Of the first sorts was the preferment
of Oswald to be Vice-Treasurer of Ireland; of
Hunter<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> and Harris to the Treasury; of Lord Digby<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a>
to the Admiralty; to which board were added, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
Grenville, Lord Howe<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> and young Thomas Pitt.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> The
Earl of Northumberland was named to the chief
government of Ireland, which had been offered to, and
refused by, Lord Granby, who, as I hinted before, was
now appointed Master of the Ordnance; from which
old Marshal Ligonier was by force removed, but softened
with a pension, which he refused to accept till
accompanied with an English peerage. General Townshend,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a>
though only a Major-General, was made Lieutenant-General
of the Ordnance; Lord Harcourt<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> replaced
Lord Northumberland as Chamberlain to the
Queen; and, in the room of the former, Lord Weymouth
was made her Master of the Horse. The
Duke of Queensberry<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> succeeded the deceased Lord
Tweedale as Justice-General of Scotland: the Seal was
given to the Duke of Athol,<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> and the Privy Seal to Mr.
Mackenzie, the Favourite’s brother. John Pitt<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> was turned
out to make room for Sir Edmund Thomas.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> Lord
March<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> and Lord Cathcart<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> obtained green ribands.</p>

<p>The Bedford faction were not to be contented with
empty honours or slight emoluments. They sent for
their Duke from France, who, to grasp the more by
seeming moderation, resigned the Privy Seal, as most
men thought, with views on the Treasury itself; at
least, his squadron vaunted that they had two or three
administrations in readiness before the King should
be obliged to employ the Opposition. The Favourite,
from the first moment of his power, had made it a
point to gratify, nay, to outrun, the Duke of Bedford’s
largest wishes. Nothing he had asked, nothing his
creatures were immodest enough to demand, had been
denied; yet Lord Bute was balked in his hopes of
purchasing the attachment of that connection—not
from their usual perfidy; he had lost them before
they suspected the smallest diminution of his omnipotence.
He had not gratified the ambition of the
Duchess.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> She had marked for herself the first post<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>

pride than to her interest, had forborne to ask it, concluding
it must be offered to her. The Princess and
Lord Bute, either not suspecting, or glad to be ignorant
of her views, were far enough from seeking to
place so dangerous a woman in the very heart of the
palace. This neglect the Duchess deeply resented,
and never forgave. She was even so weak as to declare
that inveteracy in a letter to her sister, Lady
Elizabeth Waldegrave, from Paris; which Lord Bute
intercepting, there first learned what an aspic was
lodged near his bosom.</p>

<p>But though the Favourite, persuaded of the Duchess’s
implacability, dropped all correspondence with
that faction, he was far from checking the stream
of the Crown’s graces towards them. The King
begged the support of the Duke of Marlborough,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> and
offered to make him Master of the Horse, if the Duke
of Rutland<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> could be induced to part with it. The
latter consented to exchange it for Lord Chamberlain;
but that post the Duke of Bedford insisted upon for
Lord Gower.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> After a warm struggle, Lord Gower
obtained the Chamberlain’s staff; the Duke of Rutland
remained in his old situation; and the Duke of
Marlborough, though so very young, was appointed
Lord Privy Seal; and his brother, Lord Charles
Spencer, was made Comptroller of the Household.</p>

<p>Fox obtained his barony, and retained his place, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
not without experiencing such a scene of ingratitude
as could scarce happen but to a man who had selected
his friends more for their utility than their merit. In
the discussion, and during the defending and proving
what he had or had not said relative to the cession of
the Paymaster’s place, Calcraft,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> his own creature, his
cousin, raised from extreme indigence and obscurity to
enormous wealth, to opulence so excessive that the
vast number of regiments to which he was agent, and
the outrageous plurality of places he held, were universally
believed to be deposited with him only for
Fox’s use,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> took part with Lord Shelburne, and witnessed
to the latter’s tale. Fox ordered Calcraft to
make up his accounts, dismissed him worth near
300,000<i>l.</i>, and, though so rich himself, grew almost
justified; and, though so hated, grew almost
pitied; but this was not all. The man he most loved
was Rigby; and though Fox had not crammed him
with wealth in the same lavish guise with which he had
enriched Calcraft, he had assisted in Rigby’s promotions,
and wished to push him forwards, and to be
strictly connected with him in every political walk.
In the height of his quarrel with Shelburne and Calcraft,
Fox, walking along St. James’s Street, met and
stopped Rigby’s chariot, and, leaning on the door of it,
began to vent his complaints; when the other, unprovoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
and unconcerned in the dispute, interrupted
him with these stunning sounds, “<em>You</em> tell your story
of Shelburne; <em>he</em> has a damned one to tell of you; I
do not trouble myself which is the truth;”—and pushing
him aside, ordered his coachman to drive away.
From that moment Rigby became the enemy of Fox.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a>
The necessity of relating this story will appear hereafter.</p>

<p>The Earl of Hertford was named to succeed the
Duke of Bedford at Paris. Fox, in the midst of his
quarrels and mortifications, found leisure to think
of his friends, and to think of gratifying his hatred.
He procured his wife’s brother-in-law, Mr. Bunbury,
to be imposed on Lord Hertford as secretary of the
embassy; an affront Lord Hertford was advised not
to digest: but, though he acquiesced in it, he treated
Bunbury with such obstinate coldness, that the
latter was glad to quit the employment. I never
knew why Fox was on all occasions the personal
enemy of Lord Hertford and Mr. Conway; neither
of them being hostile to him, and both most inoffensive
men. The elder brother was even a good
courtier, and never in union with Fox’s enemies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Mr. Conway’s character was indeed a reproach to
that of Fox, and antipathy is as often the cause
of enmity as offence is. The decorum and piety
of Lord Hertford occasioned men to wonder, when,
in the room of Bunbury, he chose for his secretary
the celebrated free-thinker David Hume, totally unknown
to him; but this was the effect of recommendations
from other Scots, who had much weight
with both Lord and Lady Hertford.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>While the arrangement of the new drama was
thus settling, there was an important actor to be
made easy; but it was one who, whenever he appeared
of most consequence, was sure of rendering
himself insignificant. This was Charles Townshend.
After his usual fluctuation, he accepted the post of
First Lord of the Admiralty, and actually went to
St. James’s to kiss hands for it. Presuming that
nothing would or could be refused to him, without
asking it, without even naming it to any minister,
and as if the seats of his colleagues at that Board
were in the nomination of the First Commissioner, he
carried to court with him a Mr. Burrel, one of his
followers, intending the latter should kiss hands
along with himself as another Lord of the Admiralty.
Thinking his honour engaged to carry through
this absurdity, he would not kiss the King’s hand
unless Burrel was admitted too. It was flatly refused,
and Townshend was told that the King had
no further occasion for his service. Lord Shelburne
was immediately named to succeed him at the head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
of the Board of Trade, and Lord Sandwich to fill
up the place destined to Townshend at the head
of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>These were all the public promotions calculated
to oil the new springs of Government. But the
Favourite did not close the scene of his administration
without conferring still more solid marks of
his power and friendship on his family and intimate
dependents. The reversion of Auditor<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> of the
Imprest was obtained for his own son Lord Mount-Stewart.
My place of Usher of the Exchequer was
granted in reversion to Samuel Martin;<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> and a place<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a>
in the Custom-house, held by my brother, but the far
greater share of which had been bequeathed to me by
my father for my brother’s life, was also granted in
reversion to Jenkinson.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> I was, I confess, much provoked
at this last grant, and took occasion of fomenting
the ill-humour against the Favourite, who thus
excluded me from the possibility of obtaining the continuance
of that place to myself in case of my brother’s
death; but in truth, except in the want of that attention,
I had no reason to complain. I had refused to
accept the grant<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> from Fox, and I had in terms told
Lord Bute that I would accept no favour from him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
though with great civility, and without acting in any
shape as hostile to him. Thus my resentment kept no
deep root: and I can say with the utmost truth, that
as I afterwards, though never connected with him,
was on many occasions friendly to that great favourite,
so no word in these Memoirs to his prejudice has
been dictated by a vindictive spirit, but the whole
narrative is faithfully the representation of what I
knew and heard of him. Infinite ill has he occasioned to
this country, in which light only it is my intention to
pass sentence on his character. In other respects, the
meanness of his abilities and the poorness of his spirit
place him below resentment. His private virtues, the
long and bitter persecution he has undergone, and
many domestic misfortunes, would extract every sting
which exact or necessary justice did not sharpen. The
last transaction I am going to mention flowing notoriously
from his dispensation, was of a nature not to be
palliated or forgotten. To see it in its full force of
indignity offered to so mighty a country, the reader
must place himself at the moment when England, triumphant
over France and Spain, had annihilated their
navies, and sat sole arbitress of peace and war, absolutely
secure that Europe combined could not wrench
her conquests from her, and sure of proving her moderation
by consenting to peace on almost whatever terms
she should please to dictate.</p>

<p>At that moment did a pusillanimous favourite not
only make peace, relinquishing the greater and most
valuable part of our acquisitions, but (what never
entered into the imagination of distress and slavery
itself) he purchased that scandalous peace of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
envoy of a little prince, who was not even a party in
the war! In short, it now came out, that a pension on
Ireland of one thousand pounds a year for thirty-one
years to Count Virri,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> the Sardinian Minister, through
whose hands the real negotiation<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> had passed, was the
price and tribute of that shame which Lord Bute, by
the treaty of Paris, heaped on Great Britain!</p>

<p>The very day on which the Favourite resigned the
reins of government died the man who, of all England,
would perhaps have rejoiced the most to behold
that event. James Earl Waldegrave was carried off
by the small-pox, April 8th. With unbounded benevolence,
and of the most flowing courtesy to all
men, Lord Waldegrave, whose penetration no weakness
could escape, nor art impose upon, though vice
he overlooked, and only abstained sometimes from
connecting with black and bad men,—Lord Waldegrave,
I say, had been so thoroughly fatigued with the
insipidity of his pupil the King, and so harassed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
unworthily treated by the Princess and Lord Bute,
that no one of the most inflammable vengeance, or of
the coolest resentment, could harbour more bitter hatred
and contempt than he did for the King’s mother
and favourite. This aversion carried him to what I
scarce believed my eyes when he first showed me—severe
satires against them. He has left behind him,
too, some Memoirs<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> of the few years in which he was
governor to the Prince, that will corroborate many
things I have asserted, and will not tend to make these
Anecdotes be reckoned unjust and unmerciful.</p>

<p>Lord Waldegrave died most unseasonably for his
own honour. He stood so high in the esteem of mankind
for probity, abilities, and temper, that, if any man
could, he might have accomplished a coalition of parties,
or thrown sense into that party, which, though
acting for the cause of liberty, rather wounded than
served it, so ill were they formed for counsel or conduct.
Had he lived still longer, he must, by the
deaths of the chiefs, been placed incontestably at the
head of that party himself. Indeed, but just before
his illness, he was much looked up to by very different
sets. Lord Bute himself had thought of him for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
considerable share on his own retreat; and, but the
day before Lord Waldegrave was seized with the small-pox,
he had been offered the Embassy to France or
Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland, both which he peremptorily
declined. And yet after his death the Court
boasted they had gained him,—a report much resented,
and eagerly contradicted by his friend the Duke of
Cumberland. But let us now turn to the opening of
the new Administration.</p>

<p>The Parliament had risen on April 19th, everything
being then outwardly settled. The Favourite, to give
some colour to his pretended illness, and to his still
more pretended abdication of business, went to drink
the waters at Harrowgate; having first protested that
he would neither meddle, nor offer to intercept or
direct the channel of the King’s favours. Trusting to
this declaration, there started up a triumvirate, who
not only seemed to be, but who really thought themselves,
possessed of the whole power of government.
They seemed, too, to have divided amongst themselves
the whole portion of the Favourite’s pride. These were
Mr. Grenville, his brother-in-law, Lord Egremont, and
Lord Halifax: the two latter, Secretaries of State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
Mr. Grenville<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> had hitherto been known but as
a fatiguing orator and indefatigable drudge, more
likely to disgust than to offend. Beneath this useful
unpromising outside lay lurking great abilities:
courage so confounded with obstinacy that there
was no drawing the line betwixt them; good intentions
to the public, without one great view;
much economy for that public, which in truth was
the whole amount of his good intentions; excessive
rapaciousness and parsimony in himself; infinite
self-conceit, which produced impossibility of
instructing, convincing, or setting him right; implacability
in his temper; and a total want of principles
in his political conduct; for, having long professed
himself uncommonly bigoted to the doctrines of liberty,
he became the staunchest champion of unwarrantable
power. As all his passions were expressed
by one livid smile, he never blushed at the variations
in his behaviour. His ingratitude to his benefactor,
Lord Bute, and his reproaching Mr. Pitt with the
profusion of a war which he had sometimes actively
supported, and always tacitly approved, while holding
a beneficial place,<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> were but too often paralleled
by the crimes of other men; but scarce any
man ever wore in his face such outward and
visible marks of the hollow, cruel, and rotten heart
within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
Lord Egremont<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> was a composition of pride, ill-nature,
avarice, and strict good-breeding; with such
infirmity in his frame, that he could not speak truth
on the most trivial occasion. He had humour, and
did not want sense; but had neither knowledge of
business, nor the smallest share of parliamentary abilities.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p>Of the three, Lord Halifax<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> was by far the weakest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
and at the same time the most amiable man. His
pride, like Lord Egremont’s, taught him much civility.
He spoke readily and agreeably, and only
wanted matter and argument. His profusion in
building, planting, and on a favourite mistress, had
brought him into great straits, from which he sought
to extricate himself by discreditable means. He
aimed at virtues he could not support, and was
rather carried away by his vices than sensible of
them.</p>

<p>I have mentioned Mr. Grenville’s ingratitude to
Lord Bute, which implies preceding obligation. He
had owed solely and entirely to Lord Bute the
rich reversion of a Tellership of the Exchequer for
his son. Lord Bute perhaps thought it was no light
additional favour to have made over his power into
Mr. Grenville’s hands. But the latter had not forgotten
how contemptuously he had been set aside
the last year; and, as Lord Bute by no means observed
his promise of abstaining from exerting his
influence at Court, it is but candid to allow that
Lord Bute diminished the favour by not adhering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
to the terms on which he bestowed it. Be that
how it would, Grenville had not sat a month at
the Treasury, before, remembering the affront and
forgetting the reversion, he set himself by all manner
of means to lessen the profits of the other
reversion which Lord Bute had procured for his
own son. Thus auspiciously commenced the new
administration!</p>

<p>As soon as it was known that Lord Bute intended
to quit, Wilkes had forborne to publish his
North Britons; waiting to see the consequences of
the change. The tone he had given did not, however,
stop. In the City they toasted to Wit, Beauty,
Virtue, and Honour, ironic designations of the King,
Queen, Princess Dowager, and Lord Bute. The North
Briton too was soon resumed, and on the 23rd of
April was published the memorable <em>forty-fifth</em> number,
which occasioned so much trouble to the author,
procured so essential a correction of loose and till
then undefined power, and produced so many silly
conundrums and wretched witticisms on the number
itself.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> This famous paper gave a flat lie to the
King himself, for having, by the Favourite’s suggestion,
assumed the honour of obtaining peace for the King
of Prussia.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p>Nothing could be more just than the satire,
nothing more bold than the unmeasured liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
with which it was uttered.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> The Prussian monarch
must have read with scorn, and Europe with laughter,
so absurd a boast as our vaunting to have saved an
ally whom we had betrayed and abandoned. Ridicule
might have handled this vain-glorious falsehood
with full severity and full security, without passing
the bounds which law allows. But when Parliament
had connived at the treachery, could it be supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
that it would suffer a private hand to wield the
bolt which had slept in the custody of so many corrupt
representatives? The lie given in print to the
Crown, by an obscure man, was an unparalleled license.
If the King had a particle of power left, or his servants,
or his magistrates, of spirit, such an insult
could not be passed over. The rashness of his servants
contrived to involve the Crown and themselves
in inextricable difficulties, and to make the
unwarrantable behaviour of Wilkes appear innocent,
when compared with the excesses they committed
themselves.</p>

<p>I do not mean to lead the reader through the
maze of vague and barbarous law-proceedings, which
sprang out of this transaction. It did but lay open
the undefined or unmeaning magazine of terms
which the chicanery or contradictions of ages had
heaped together, and it proved that the Crown and
the subject might be justified in almost any excesses.
The right hand of Nonsense armed the King,
and her left defended the subject. The lawyers on
either side were employed in discovering springes or
loop-holes.</p>

<p>After a week’s deliberation Wilkes was seized,
April 30th, by three messengers, on a <em>general warrant</em>,
signed by Lord Halifax. They had been ordered to
apprehend him at midnight, but abstained till noon of
the 30th. Churchill, his friend, then with him, slipped
out of the house, either to secure himself or to give
the alarm. Mr. Wood,<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> the Under-Secretary, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
Philip Carteret Webbe,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> a most villanous tool and
agent in any iniquity, seized his papers, though he had
received intimation time enough to convey away the
most material. He was conducted to Lord Halifax’s,
where he behaved with much firmness and confidence,
and grievously wounded the haughty dignity attempted
to be assumed by Lord Egremont. They committed
him close prisoner to the Tower; a severity rarely, and
never fit to be practised but in cases of most dangerous
treason. This treatment served but to increase
Wilkes’s spirit and wit. He desired to be confined
in the same room where Sir William Windham, Lord
Egremont’s father, had been kept on a charge of
Jacobitism; and said he hoped, if there could be found
such a chamber in the Tower, that he might not be
lodged where any Scotchman had been prisoner.</p>

<p>About the same time, being told of the reasons
alleged by the King of Spain<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> for setting aside his
eldest son, two of which were, that the Prince
squinted, and did not believe the mysteries of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
holy religion; then said Wilkes, “I can never be King of
Spain, for I squint, and believe none of those mysteries.”</p>

<p>The rigour of the commitment gave serious alarm;
but, the very day on which it happened, Wilkes’s
friends applied to the Court of Common Pleas for
his habeas corpus, expecting it from Lord Chief
Justice Pratt, and scorning or despairing of it from
Lord Mansfield.</p>

<p>Lord Temple instantly resorted to the Tower, but
was denied admittance to the prisoner; a restraint the
ministers found the very next day they must take off.
Lord Temple then returned to visit Wilkes, as did the
Duke of Grafton and some few others of rank; but,
in general, the prisoner’s character was so bad, and
his conduct so rash and unguarded, that few who
were either decent or cautious cared to be concerned
with him.</p>

<p>The habeas corpus being granted, Wilkes was
carried to the Court of Common Pleas, May 3rd.
He spoke for an hour, said “attempts had been
made to corrupt him, now to persecute him; he
had been worse treated than any rebel Scot.” The
crowd in Westminster-hall gave a great shout; the
Chief Justice, with great dignity, reproved them. The
judges took time to deliberate. The people were
profuse of their acclamations to the sufferer.</p>

<p>On the 5th, he wrote a letter to his daughter
(a child whom he had placed in a convent in France
for her education), and sent it open to Lord Halifax;
it congratulated her on living in a <em>free</em> country. He
was the same day turned out of his commission in the
militia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
On the 6th, being again conveyed from the Tower
to Westminster-hall, Pratt and the other judges of
the Common Pleas unanimously discharged him from
his confinement; the Chief Justice delivering their
opinions, and dismissing him on his parliamentary
privilege, “<em>because</em>, though privilege of Parliament
does not hold against a breach of the peace, it does
against what only <em>tends</em> to a breach of the peace.
The case of the seven bishops was quoted; the judges
Wright, Holloway, and Allibone had been against
them. Allibone, said Pratt, was a Papist; Wright
and Holloway had been appointed for the occasion;
but Powel, an honest man, had declared for the
bishops. On the other hand, he quoted a recent
case of Lord Tankerville, who having been arrested
on a prosecution for bribery in the election for
Windsor, the Lords had declared it a breach of privilege”—we
shall find how much less tender the Commons
were of <em>their</em> privileges.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice had no sooner granted the enlargement
of Wilkes, than two of the King’s serjeants
presented letters to the Court, from the Attorney and
Solicitor Generals, demanding to be admitted into the
Court, as the case concerned the King’s interest. The
Attorney, it is said, has a right of interfering in any
Court where the King’s interest is agitated; it is
doubted whether the Solicitor has the same prerogative.
To both Pratt answered, that they had applied
too late. Now did the Court feel the consequence of
having forced Pratt to be Chief Justice against his will.</p>

<p>This triumph quite overset the little discretion
of which Wilkes had been master. He seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
put himself into the situation of a King, who, not
content with the outworks with which the law has
surrounded his person, attempts to employ the law
as offensive artillery. Affecting to have been robbed
of moveables when his papers were seized, Wilkes
entered into a virulent controversy, by letter, with the
Secretaries of State; and even endeavoured, though
in vain, to obtain warrants for searching their houses.
This wild conduct did not help his cause. His next
step fell more perniciously on his own head. He
erected a printing-press in his own house; and, against
the remonstrances of Lord Temple, who never wanted
fear where there was room for it, and who had no
taste for anything that did not lead directly home to
faction, indulged himself in realizing those sallies of
his humour and intemperance, which are scarcely
excusable when transient and confined to the jollity of
intoxicated moments at table. The Court regarding
Lord Temple as the instigator, not as the Socrates, of
this Alcibiades, removed him from the lord-lieutenancy
of the county of Buckingham. The printers,
who had been vexed in their business by the orders
of the Secretaries of State, and encouraged by the
victory of Wilkes, prosecuted the messengers, and obtained
damages to the value of 300<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The same spirit spread into the west. In the cider
counties they dressed up a figure in Scotch plaid,
with a blue riband, to represent the Favourite, and
this figure seemed to lead by the nose an ass royally
crowned. At the same time they voted instructions
to their members to try to obtain a repeal of the act.
The circumstance of the act being passed under so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
unpopular an administration was most unfortunate.
It had taken thirty years to open the eyes of mankind
to the benefits of excise: the only, at least the best,
method of improving the revenue without imposing
new burthens. Being started at so ungracious a moment,
the old prejudices were industriously revived.</p>

<p>The Court at the same time met with some mortifications
in their pursuit of congratulatory addresses
on the peace, which they sedulously promoted. One
Judge Perrot<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> was so servile as to recommend it from
the bench on the circuit. The Duke of Newcastle
and Lord Hardwicke, the one Chancellor, the other
High Steward of the University of Cambridge, refused
to go to St. James’s with the address of that body.
Allen,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> the ostentatious patron of Pope and Warburton,
the latter of whom had married his natural daughter,
prevailed on the city of Bath to thank the King
for the <em>adequate</em><a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> peace, and had himself the insolence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
or folly to send that address, so profligately worded,
to Mr. Pitt, with whom he had maintained a mutual
intercourse of flattery. Mr. Pitt disdained to present
their compliment to the King, and even declared he
would represent their city no more.</p>

<p>Wilkes, in the meantime, had gone to France to
visit his daughter. There he received a challenge
from one Forbes<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> an outlawed Scot in the French
service, who could not digest the torrents of abuse
which Wilkes had poured forth on his country. Alexander
Murray, brother of Lord Elibank, and an outlaw
too since the Westminster Election in 1751,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> was
the go-between in this quarrel, not without being
suspected of inflaming it. Wilkes accepted the defiance
for the next morning, but, when Forbes called
on him, affected to laugh it off, saying, he was bound
to fight Lord Egremont by preference before any
other man. When that excuse availed not, he asked
Forbes if he had provided a second; to which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
other replied, such preparation was too dangerous in
France. Altercations thickened, till at last the lieutenant
de police was sent for, who obliged Forbes to
promise not to proceed any farther.</p>

<p>Had the duel with Lord Egremont been seriously
intended, from that too would Wilkes have been
delivered; for the earl, who was of a sanguine and
apoplectic complexion, of which he had felt attacks,
and though warned in vain to moderate the indulgence
of his palate, to which he was ungovernably prone,
died suddenly on the 21st of August, and put an end
to a triumvirate which had involved their master and
themselves in such a labyrinth of knotty and undecided
questions.</p>

<p>But it was not the affair of Wilkes which had alone
perplexed the Triumvirate. They found they were by
no means in the confidence of the King. He was
continually suggesting new measures to them, which
plainly came from a hidden quarter. A fortnight
before the death of Lord Egremont, his Majesty had
hinted to Grenville that he wished to prevail on Lord
Hardwicke to return, if not to his service, at least to
his councils. Whether the blow received from the
Common Pleas had alarmed the Favourite (who had
made but a very short stay at Harrowgate), and had
warned him to look out for more support; or whether
he thought the three ministers insufficient; or whether,
which is most likely, he wished already to get rid of
them, especially having detected the underhand practices
of Grenville against his son’s patent;—in short,
whatever was the motive, Grenville could not be ignorant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
who was author of the advice, and only replied,
<em>it would not do</em>. The King insisted, and the overture
was made; Hardwicke rejected it, and said he would
not abandon Newcastle. The King then commanded
the same trial to be made on Newcastle, but with
exclusion of Mr. Pitt; an early proof of those crooked
councils of division with which the Favourite was
afterwards so often charged, and which were so agreeable
to the King’s natural insincerity. Newcastle
haughtily refused the offers made to him. Still were
the King’s discourses dark and ambiguous; and, though
affecting to call out for new strength by extending
preferments, he had refused, at Grenville’s recommendation,
to make the Duke of Leeds<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> President of
the Council, and Lord Hyde<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> Chief Justice in Eyre.</p>

<p>On this behaviour the three ministers had determined
to bring his Majesty to an explanation. Lord
Halifax broke the ice; complained of their not having
his countenance, and concluded with telling him that
he had but three options: to support them; to try a
coalition of parties, which was impracticable; or to
surrender himself, bound hand and foot, to Mr. Pitt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
Mr. Grenville went much farther; reproached him
with violating the assurances he had given them that
Lord Bute should meddle no more, and with abandoning
the ministers he had himself chosen. The
King renewed his professions, and promised to be firm
to them. Grenville said he should go into the country
for a fortnight, and begged the King to take his
final resolution against that time. At Grenville’s
return the King had renewed his protestations, and,
the very day before Lord Egremont died, Grenville
had been to assure him of the King’s promise to be
true to them; but, on the 25th, Grenville, through
great professions to him, perceived that his Majesty
was not without a disposition of recalling Pitt, against
which Grenville made a warm, not to say indecent,
remonstrance and protest.</p>

<p>The Bedfords in the interim had totally renounced
Bute. The Duchess had carried her animosity still
higher, and would not, on her return from the French
embassy, be prevailed on to pay her duty to the Princess
of Wales. Casting about for allies (for Grenville
and Lord Halifax they despised), the Bedford faction
had not been without views of connecting with the
Duke of Cumberland and Newcastle; and his Royal
Highness had at this very juncture been invited to
Woburn. The death of Lord Egremont seeming to
dissolve that ministry, a bolder stroke was struck; and
the Bedfords, hoping under him to get possession of
the government, determined to attempt making Mr.
Pitt minister. With this view Rigby, in the most
private and mysterious manner, went down to Woodstock,
and sent for the Duke of Bedford, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
then at Blenheim, and persuaded him to go directly to
town to the King, and advise him to send for Mr.
Pitt.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> Lord Shelburne, who in his separate department
had affected to act minister too, had assured
them that this would not be opposed by Lord Bute;
but had not trusted them, or was not trusted himself,
with Lord Bute’s real disposition that way. Rigby
had no sooner lighted the match than he left the mine
to take fire, and retired to his own house in the country;
while the Duke of Bedford posted to the King,
and told him, that, as he had made peace abroad, he
must now make it at home, and that could only be
effected by sending for Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>Lord Bute, hearing this measure had been prescribed
by the Duke of Bedford, thought it wiser to
have the merit of it himself. Mr. Pitt, though trusting
to the clamour of party for support, had seldom
openly courted it; and, since he had had such eminent
services to boast, had affected to despise it. He had
kept clear of all transactions with Wilkes, and had
condemned Lord Temple’s connection with him, and,
yet more, his visits to that incendiary in the Tower.
Mr. Pitt’s amity might reconcile the people, and no
man was so accommodating a partner in power; Pitt
having few or no dependents, and scorning to meddle
in the distribution of common places and preferments.
On these grounds the Favourite, through the intervention
of Alderman Beckford, entered into a negotiation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
with Mr. Pitt, and, finding facilities there beyond his
most sanguine hopes, induced the King to send for
that formidable dictator.</p>

<p>It was on the 28th of August that Mr. Grenville,
arriving at Buckingham House, was struck with the
apparition of Mr. Pitt’s chair and servants in the
Court. This was the first notice he or the public received
of a phenomenon so little expected, at least by
the latter.</p>

<p>Let it be remarked here, that I do not pretend to
give a perfect and entire account of the following
negotiation. No transaction was ever involved in
more contradictions and mystery; for, though the
retainers of both sides spoke out, and amply, their
narratives disagreed materially, and the exact truth
was never fully known. From all I could collect then
or since, and from explanations which I have gathered
by commenting on the subsequent behaviour of the
actors, I believe the ensuing relation is pretty near the
truth.</p>

<p>The Bedfords had sent Calcraft to Hayes<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> to sound
how Mr. Pitt stood affected to them, and Calcraft
returned with a most favourable account. On this
assurance had the Duke of Bedford been pushed on
the measure of advising the recall of Mr. Pitt. Lord
Bute had not been less encouraged by the report of
Alderman Beckford, for Mr. Pitt had determined, if
ever he should return to Court, not to make himself unwelcome
there. The Favourite, therefore, saw him privately
at his house in Jermyn-street before he saw the
King, and advised him not to propose Lord Temple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
for the Treasury, which would break off the negotiation.
Pitt thanked him, but did not take his advice,—and
on this rock undoubtedly did the treaty split;
for all the variations I have hinted at, were but circumstances
artfully seized or feigned to colour the rupture,
or misrepresent it.</p>

<p>The Favourite deceived, or deceiving himself, brought
about the interview, as I have said, between the King
and Mr. Pitt. It lasted three hours, and the bargain
was universally thought concluded. But the King had
not only been revolted at Mr. Pitt’s terms, though
without owning it, but Mr. Pitt had had the sagacity
to discover his Majesty’s repugnance; and therefore
not only carried on the farce of returning to Court the
next day, but was so dexterous as to see the Duke of
Newcastle, with whose interests he had by no means
clogged his first demands; and assuring his Grace of
his zeal for his service, went back to the King with a
schedule of terms extremely enlarged. These were
peremptorily rejected, and the treaty broke off, on
pretences which the one had not meaned to ask, nor
the other cared whether he granted or refused. The
Treasury for Lord Temple was the real stone of offence.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
But no sooner was the rupture known, than all
tongues were let loose to inquire, guess, invent, or
assign causes. The King detailed his conversation
with Mr. Pitt to all that came about him—and almost
all added to it, as their interest or malice suggested.
Mr. Pitt saw very few, and to fewer would disclose
any circumstances. He soon found that he could not
speak without flatly contradicting what his Majesty
had said, or was reported to have said. No wonder
the transaction came forth loaded with uncertainties
and inconsistence!</p>

<p>The substance reported was, that Mr. Pitt had
proscribed almost all the ministry then existing, and
yet had been very cool in recommendations of the
Opposition. The first part was not very credible, for
though his haughtiness rendered him indifferent to
those who affected to call themselves his party, his
nature, on the other hand, was not vindictive: and it
was true, that he had not been worse treated by the
one set than by the other. On his second audience, I
believe it might be true to a good degree that he had
been dictatorial; but at first he had been far more
moderate. However, it was given out that he proscribed
all who had made, or had voted for the peace:
whereas he had spoken tenderly of some of the negotiators;
and had said of the treaty itself, that he would
take it, and make the best he could of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
The King himself relating the two conversations,
took care to dwell on any circumstances that would
most affect the persons to whom he made the confidence.
Thus, to Lord Hertford, at that time Lord of
the Bedchamber in waiting, the King said, “Mr.
Pitt proscribed several, particularly your friend Lord
Powis:<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> I told him, continued his Majesty, that he
might restore Lord George Cavendish;<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> but Lord
Powis had stuck by me, and I never would abandon
him.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> I will stand by those who have stood by me.
He said little,” continued the King, “of Legge (another
of Lord Hertford’s friends, consequently the King
intended Legge should be informed), only, having
recommended Lord Temple for the Treasury, Mr.
Pitt said, Mr. Legge may be his Chancellor of the
Exchequer, if he pleases—if not, <em>Lord Temple will
name another</em>. He surprised me,” pursued the King to
Lord Hertford, “with saying still less of your relation
the Duke of Grafton; and more, with crying up to me
for one of the first men of business in the kingdom,
Lord Rockingham,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> whom he intended for First Lord
of the Admiralty. I thought,” said his Majesty, “I had
not two men in my bedchamber of less parts than
Lord Rockingham.” The King spoke handsomely of
both the Dukes of Grafton and Devonshire, and laid
his treatment of the latter on passion, that Duke not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
having made the least excuse for not coming to council
when he had been summoned. Knowing that Lord
Hertford was not well with Fox, the King affirmed
that he had taken the latter last winter against his
inclination; and he told Lord Hertford that the Duke
of Newcastle had urged the Duke of Bedford to make
a worse peace than Mr. Pitt had projected, and had
promised to defend it: and that the Duke of Devonshire
had recommended to the Duke of Bedford to
make <em>any</em> peace; and then, fearing to be reproached
with that advice, always avoided conversation with
that Duke. “When he took leave of me,” added the
King, “Mr. Pitt said to me, Sir, the House of Commons
will not force me upon your Majesty, and I will
never come into your service against your consent.”
“You see,” said Lord Hertford, when he repeated this
conversation to me, “that if they did not shut the
King up, he would talk enough to any body!”—but if
they sometimes debarred him from talking, he was
now instructed to talk—and every grain he sowed
brought forth an hundred-fold.</p>

<p>I must observe that his Majesty had told Lady Holland,
in the drawing-room, that he should never forget
Mr. Fox’s undertaking the House of Commons and
the Peace in the last winter. It is certain that in this
interview with Mr. Pitt, the King <em>proposed</em> to take
the Paymaster’s place from Fox, and bestow it on
George Grenville.</p>

<p>Of the persons really proscribed, the chief was Lord
Mansfield. “He is a Jacobite,” said Pitt, “and means
sir, to ruin your family.” He recommended Pratt for
a peerage, and in future for the Chancellor’s Seals;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
would have saved the Duke of Marlborough, as a
young man misled; Elliot, for having tried to preserve
union between him and Lord Bute; and of Lord
Halifax he had said, “that he was a pretty man, and, as
in bad circumstances, might be Groom of the Stole or
Paymaster.” “The Duke of Newcastle,” he said,
“would take any place not of business.” Charles
Townshend he proposed for Secretary of State with
himself. The Secretary at War should not be of
consequence, as it was now under Ellis,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> that clerk of
Fox the Paymaster, but should depend on him whom
his Majesty should think proper to command his army.
“Then,” said the King, “we shall agree in Lord
Granby;” “or,” said Pitt, “in Lord Albemarle.”<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> This
was the sole approach he seemed to make towards the
Duke of Cumberland; but never would his Majesty
have trusted his army with a creature of his uncle.</p>

<p>Of Lord Gower Pitt spoke not favourably, having
probably discovered that it was the way to make his
court to the Favourite, who, having perceived that that
Lord aimed at being a favourite himself, had taken care
to alienate the King’s mind from him. Rigby was not
excepted for mercy,<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> and Lord Sandwich much less.
Of the Duke of Bedford Mr. Pitt spoke properly, as
of a man well-intentioned, but shamefully misguided,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
and who might hereafter, if in proper hands, be useful
to Government. But nothing harsh did Pitt utter
against the peace: he would try to <em>meliorate</em> it.
Should a national spirit of inquiry arise, he would not
resist it. He had held the same language formerly on
the loss of Minorca: they were specious words then
and now, but with no sanguinary intentions.</p>

<p>When Calcraft was reproached by the Bedford faction
with having deceived them on Pitt’s disposition
towards them, he could not evade the charge. A
breach ensued, and he remained attached to Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>Sandwich, finding himself proscribed by Pitt, made
advantage of the moment, and exerting all his invention
and industry, of which no man possessed a larger
receipt, he set himself to persuade men of all denominations
that they had been marked in black
letters in the dictator’s catalogue of pains and penalties.
He even drew every man’s character to himself,
and selecting their faults or deficiencies, ascribed to
Mr. Pitt both the recapitulation and imaginary sentence
that followed it. Grenville and Lord Halifax
caught the righteous flame, and diffused it: Grenville
even assembling the Commissioners of the several
boards, and assuring them, one and all, that they had
been condemned by Mr. Pitt to be cashiered. To
Woburn, where the Duke of Bedford was at this
anxious moment detained by his royal visitor, the
Duke of Cumberland, Lord Sandwich wrote inflammatory
letters, telling Bedford that he was proscribed,
and his peace to be attacked. The warm little Duke
caught fire; but Rigby, to whom Sandwich had made
the same report, doubted, and came to town, where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
was either duped into, or persuaded to join in the imposition.</p>

<p>Grenville was pressed by the King to remain
minister, and did not want to be pressed. The Duke
of Bedford, in the hot fit of zeal and resentment,
accepted the post of President; and Shelburne, who
had shuffled round the compass with so ill success, and
lost the favour of Lord Bute, choosing now to adhere
to Pitt, and resigning the seals, they were bestowed
on the only man who could replace, or excel him,
Lord Sandwich. It was fortunate for Grenville and
union, that the faction did not wish to place the Duke
of Bedford at the head of the Treasury,—but they
could not trust his warmth and absurdities. In Ireland
he had disgusted everybody, and had gone so far
as to tell the Irish themselves that theirs was no
Parliament. The Court had wished to have Charles
Townshend Secretary of State with Lord Halifax;
but he too, for that time, stuck to Mr. Pitt, and
refused.</p>

<p>Thus, from a strange concurrence of jarring causes,
there sprung up out of great weakness a strong and
cemented ministry, who all acquiesced in the predominant
power of Grenville. The Favourite hated,
had tried to shake him off, and he knew it. How
much must his brother Temple have been detested at
Court, when, under all these humiliating aspects, it
was thought preferable to retain Grenville!</p>

<p>In truth, nothing could be more offensive than Lord
Temple’s conduct, whether considered in a public or
private light. Opposition to his factious views seemed
to let him loose from all ties, all restraint of principles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
Of the truth of this assertion he, at the time I am describing,
gave a convincing proof. His brother George
was at that moment the object of his jealousy and resentment.
He had, however, been prevailed upon by his
family, or rather by considerations of family, to suffer
Mr. Grenville to be rechosen for Buckingham; but on
this sole condition, that Mr. Grenville should give up
a paper formerly received from him. When Dr. Lyttelton,
Bishop of Carlisle,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> who had negotiated this treaty,
gave him the paper, he said, after reading it, “It is
true, I am bound in honour and by promise to make a
firm entail of my estate,—I will; but it shall be on
my brother James.”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> The case was this: it had been
discovered during the life of their uncle, the late Lord
Cobham, that he had made a flaw in the settlement
of his estate. A meeting of his nephews was held in
the presence of his sister,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> and their mother, the late
Lady Temple. She said, “My son Richard is ill with
my brother; if we tell my brother of this flaw, he may
make a new settlement, and give his fortune from my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
eldest son.” George Grenville consented to keep the
secret, provided his brother gave him the most solemn
promise in writing to resettle the estate when he
should come to it. Insensible to such a tie, and filled
with rancour, he had the mortification of seeing that
very brother preserved in power merely to his exclusion.</p>

<p>Other persons preferred on the new settlement
were Lord Egmont to the head of the Admiralty, and
Lord Hyde to be joint-Postmaster.</p>

<p>Still did the same grievance remain, the favour and
secret power of Lord Bute. Grenville and Lord Halifax
insisted that he should go abroad; and it was said
to be promised. At least his refusal, or breach of
promise, was made the pretence for depriving him of
the custody of the King’s Privy-purse, an office he yet
retained. The nomination of a successor showed how
little the ministers had gained, and how vainly they
endeavoured to destroy his credit, the Purse being immediately
given to Sir William Breton, who was Groom
of the Bedchamber to the King, as he had been to the
King’s father, and who was a most devoted tool of the
Princess and her favourite. A stronger proof of the
latter’s confidence in his own power was given by himself.
George Grenville having written a very voluminous
letter to Sir John Phillips, giving an account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
the negotiation with Mr. Pitt and its miscarriage, of
which letter the King had seen and approved every
paragraph, Sir John wrote a warm expostulation to
Lord Bute (who he did not know had been concerned
in that treaty), blaming the timidity of sending for
Mr. Pitt. Lord Bute returned a haughty answer, in
which he said, <em>whatever the ministers might think, they
should find he himself was minister still</em>. A memorable
sentence, confirmed by facts, and of which the contrary
assertion was vainly attempted afterwards to be imposed
upon the world.</p>

<p>The mysteries of this man’s conduct, and the reserve
and eccentric starts of Mr. Pitt, have made any lights
valuable that can be thrown on this part of our history.
Mr. Pitt’s was the character suited to support and colour
over the pusillanimity of the Favourite, but his jealousy
and their mutual pride threw them at a distance. The
affair of Lord George Sackville, who was attached to
Lord Bute, and proscribed by Pitt in compliment to
Prince Ferdinand, had given the finishing stroke to
their rupture; hastened too, by that very attachment
of Mr. Pitt to the foreign house of Brunswick. Nor,
with all the disposition of Pitt to forgive the Favourite’s
offences, could they meet again, while Lord Temple
hung upon his brother-in-law, and was the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine quâ
non</i> of Mr. Pitt’s return to Court. On every occasion
of moment appeared the justness of the character
drawn of Lord Bute by the late Prince of Wales,
who did not want parts, nor ill-nature to sharpen
those parts, nor insolence to utter what either of
them dictated. Growing tired of Lord Bute a little
before his death, he said to him, “Bute, you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
make an excellent ambassador in some proud little
Court where there is nothing to do.” It had been
happy for England, and for Lord Bute too, if the
Prince could have made that destination of him—I
mean, without living to execute it himself.</p>

<p>I shall relate another very extraordinary anecdote,
which will not be mentioned improperly in this place,
though I do not know the precise time in which it
happened. The Princess Dowager dreamed that she
was in the palace of Saxe Gotha: the window was
open, and the moon, level to it, shook with a tremulous
motion before her eyes, to her great disquiet. She
bade Lord Bute try to fix it. Extending his arms to
stop its motion, it burst in his hand into ten thousand
fiery splinters; on which, turning to the Princess, he
said reproachfully, “See, Madam, to what you have
brought me!” This dream was the Princess so weak
as to repeat the next morning to some of her women;
one of whom, I guess the wife of Velters Cornwall,
told it to Lady Suffolk,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> who trusted it to me. She
did not name her authority, but said she heard it from
one of the Princess’s bedchamber; and Mrs. Cornwall
I know was the one with whom Lady Suffolk was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
most connected. I repeat this vision, not as prophetic
or divine, but as a strong picture of what passed in the
mind on which it painted itself.</p>

<p>Before I close this account of the negotiation, I
ought to assign the reason why Mr. Pitt had so
slightingly or offensively mentioned Mr. Legge, the
second in Opposition, and long the second to Mr.
Pitt himself. With all his abilities, Legge was
of a creeping underhand nature, and aspired to the
lion’s place by the manœuvre of the mole. While yet
connected with Mr. Pitt, and before he had lost favour
at Leicester House,<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> he had, before the late King’s
death, brought about a secret interview with Newcastle;
but with so much circumspection, that meeting
him at Lord Duplin’s, Legge had insisted the conversation
should pass without candles and in the dark.
The Duke was charmed with the mystery, and with
the pleasure of betraying it to Mr. Pitt. Mr. Elliot,
as he told me himself, discovered it too, and acquainted
Lord Bute—and thus with both was Legge ruined. I
now return to the common occurrences of the year.</p>

<p>In one point the Favourite and his rivals agreed;
that is, in the destruction of Wilkes. The rashness
and despotic conduct of the triumvirate had made
them parties in the same cause; they pursuing him
with what they called Law, and the Scotch without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
attention to any law. Johnstone, one of Lord Bute’s
American governors,<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> had the same view with Forbes,
but took a looser plan. Having been reflected on in
a North Briton, I think then no longer written by
Wilkes, he challenged the author, whoever it was;
and, to be sure of provoking at least one person, threw
out in his challenge printed in the newspapers, severe
sarcasms on Lord Temple’s want of spirit.</p>

<p>About this time General Wall,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> a true friend to the
union of England and Spain, finding the French interest
daily making greater progress at Madrid, desired
leave to resign on pretence of failure of his eyesight.
Grimaldi<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> was immediately ordered home from Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
to succeed him; a man devoted to France. To that
Court Lord Hertford set out on the 13th of October,
and Monsieur de Guerchy arrived thence. The Comte
de Guerchy<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> was an amiable soldier; not to be named
for parts, but far better qualified for his situation than
his own Court believed, having a good knowledge of
the world, a perpetual attention to his employment,
consummate discretion, much natural ease in his behaviour,
with either no impertinence, or with thorough
mastery of it, and a complaisance so properly applied
that he was agreeable to all parties, and yet always
well with the reigning ministry here. It gave him a
ridicule at home, that he was enslaved to a penurious
and deformed wife; but that dominion of Madame de
Guerchy was his greatest felicity. She had an excellent
understanding, and a talent for learning the tempers,
humours, and connections of England; her constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
application to which, and the necessary curiosity
in consequence, were concealed by the natural coldness
and reserve of her disposition. Nor did her attention
to their fortune ever disgrace her husband, nor throw
even an air of economy on his table. At Paris her
devotion and domestic retirement had passed for insipid
virtues that prevented her good sense from being
so much as suspected. At the Count’s first audience
he told the King, with pleasant candour, <em>that it was a
proof of his master’s intentions to preserve the peace, that
he was sent over, who was no man of talents or intrigue</em>.</p>

<p>Thus formed to succeed and never to offend, no man
was more unfortunate than this ambassador; and it
required not only dexterity, but the simplicity of his
conduct, to surmount the most cruel and disagreeable
ideas, first carelessly dropped, and then maliciously
dispersed to his prejudice. The Duc de Nivernois
had brought over and left here, to manage the affairs
of their Court till M. de Guerchy’s arrival, the Chevalier
D’Eon,<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> a military man, but who had been much
employed in secret negotiations in Russia, for which
he had been largely praised and very ill paid. The
man had notable parts, great appearance of bashful
merit, and learning enough to charm the superficial
pedantry of the Duke, who had treated him with a
fondness and intimacy that was ridiculous; and that,
by being over kind, proved cruel: for having to serve
him made D’Eon the courier of the peace, the Duke
went farther, and procured him to be styled plenipotentiary
during the absence of the ambassador. Vigils<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
and vanity turned the poor young man’s head, which
was by no means ballasted by a good heart. He mistook
the road of fortune for fortune itself, and thought
that highsounding titles lifted him to a level with
those that conferred them. He forgot his modesty,
and learned to talk loftily, or, as his masters thought,
arrogantly. Under this unhappy intoxication he was
thunderstruck with a declaration from the Duc de
Nivernois, that on the ambassador’s arrival he was to
sink into his pristine insignificance. To laugh this off,
the Duke had familiarly pictured him to himself as
sometimes a plenipotentiary and sometimes a tool of
office. Other accidents concurred to aggravate this
mortifying notice. He could obtain no arrears; and
having made free with the remittances of his new master
to give dignity to his own mission, he received a
very humiliating reprimand from Monsieur de Guerchy.
To crown all, Wilkes’s writings had breathed a
spirit of independence into a poor brain born to crouch
at a desk or to rise by servility. The ambassador was
no sooner arrived, than the Chevalier behaved in a
manner to which French ministers are little accustomed
from their inferiors. At the same time D’Eon
took it into his fancy that one Treyssac de Vergy,<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> an
adventurer, was brought over to assassinate him; and
on this belief broke out so outrageously against the
Count after dinner at Lord Halifax’s, that the Earl, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
M. de Guerchy’s desire, was obliged to send for Justice
Fielding, and put D’Eon under arrest; and next
day Vergy swore the peace<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> against him. The consequences
of this adventure will be related hereafter.</p>

<p>Augustus the Third<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> having enjoyed but for few
months the cessation of war, and of those misfortunes
which a vain and impertinent favourite<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> had drawn
down upon him, died about this time, leaving Poland
at liberty to get rid of a family who had sacrificed their
religion for a crown, without obtaining essential benefits
for themselves, or conferring any on subjects so
dearly purchased. The new Elector of Saxony, his
son, was infirm in mind and body, and survived his
father not a year.</p>

<p>We, on whom an empty favourite had heaped little
less disgrace by peace than Count Bruhl had inflicted
on Saxony by war, had occasion to feel how wide the
terror of our arms had extended our influence. The
Duke of York, making the tour of the Mediterranean,
and being expected at Florence, the Pope<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Cardinal Albani to inform Sir Horace Mann, the
King’s minister in Tuscany, that his Royal Highness,
if he pleased to visit Rome, would be received there
with all the honours due to his birth. The nuncio at
Florence was commanded too to wait on the Prince,
and repeat the same; to invite him to Rome, and to
assure him of all safety, honours, and amusements.
His Royal Highness accepted the invitation; and the
son of James the Second, and his grandson, a cardinal
of that very church, had the mortification of being
forced to retire to Albano, where they had a villa, lest
they should see a heretic Duke of York courted and
treated in that holy city whence the thunders of the
Vatican had been hurled against the great Elizabeth.
But this was not the last nor least humiliation which
the wretched and helpless line of Stuart received from
the hands of their Pontiff, and from that church for
which they had sacrificed themselves, their crowns, and
their posterity.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of November Charles Yorke resigned the
post of Attorney-General, alleging to Mr. Grenville
that his father and the Duke of Newcastle had insisted
upon it. Yorke, on the trial of the printers,
had made a warm speech against Wilkes, and was to
carry on the prosecution. The father and the sons
were certainly in their hearts inclined to prerogative;
but interest so swayed their actions, and it was so
much the point of the whole family that Charles
Yorke should be Chancellor, that we shall find one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
perpetual stream of dubitation and trimming run
through their conduct. The father, indeed, more
soured, and with pride more affronted, towards this
close of his life, grew more settled in his asperity
towards the Court. Nor was he the only instrument
of prerogative whom the Court lost because it could
not reward all its devotees up to their ambition.</p>

<p>In Ireland the scene commenced unfavourably. The
new Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of Northumberland,<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>
lost a question the first day in the House of Commons
there by so considerable a number as forty, who would
not suffer the word <em>adequate</em> to be applied to the Peace
in the address.</p>

<p>But in the Parliament of England lay the chief seat
of the war; and with very extraordinary scenes did the
campaign open. The Houses met November 15th,
Lord Hilsborough and Lord Suffolk moved the Address
of the Peers. Lord Temple censured the Peace;
and the Duke of Bedford defended it with temper.
Lord Gower attacked Lord Temple for his disrespect
to the King. He denied that he had ever shown any
disrespect; and said that he and his family had been
attached to <em>this</em> royal family <em>full as long</em> as his lordship’s
family had (who were very recent converts from
Jacobitism).</p>

<p>As soon as the Address was voted, Lord Sandwich
produced a poem, called an Essay on Woman, with
notes pretended to be written by Bishop Warburton.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
It was a performance bawdy and blasphemous to the
last degree, being a parody of <cite>Pope’s Essay on Man</cite>,
and of other pieces, adapted to the grossest ideas, or
to the most profane. Wilkes and Potter,<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> son of the
late Archbishop of Canterbury, had formerly composed
this indecent patchwork in some of their bacchanalian
hours; and Wilkes, not content with provoking the
vengeance of the King, of the Princess, of the Favourite,
of twenty subaltern ministers, and of the whole
Scottish nation, had, for the amusement of his idle
hours, consigned this <em>innocent</em> rhapsody to his own
printing-press—a folly unparalleled, though he had intended
to restrain the edition to twelve copies. However,
as he could not commit a wanton imprudence
without giving birth to some villainy or tyranny in
others, this very poem was now laid before the House
of Lords in consequence of a train of both kinds.
One of the copies had been seized among his papers
by Philip Carteret Webbe. Still was even that ministry
ashamed to accuse Wilkes on evidence which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
had fallen into their hands by such illegal means—unanswerable
proof that they were conscious of their
guilt, and knew they could not justify their proceedings.
But the blood-hounds having thus fallen on the scent,
were not to be turned aside by delicacies. Could they
procure another copy the business would be effected—and
effected it was. Carteret Webbe set his tools to
work, for even hangmen have deputies. There was
one Kidgell, a dainty priggish parson, much in vogue
among the old ladies for his gossiping and quaint
sermons, and chaplain to the Scotch<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> Earl of March.
This fellow got at a proof-sheet; and by the treachery of
one of Wilkes’s printers, who thought himself ill-used,
and by the encouragement of his patron, who consulted
Lord Bute and Lord Sandwich, and was egged
on by them to proceed, Kidgell and Webbe purchased
the whole poem: and now did Sandwich, who had
hugged this mischief for months in his breast, lay open
the precious poem before his brother Lords in strains
of more hypocrisy<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> than would have been tolerable
even in a professed Methodist. Parts of it were read,
most coarsely and disgustingly blasphemous. Lord
Lyttelton groaned in spirit, and begged they might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
hear no more. Bishop Warburton, who had not the
luck, like Lord Lyttelton, to have his conversion believed
by any one, foamed with the violence of a Saint
Dominic; vaunted that he had combated infidelity, and
laid it under his feet; and said, the blackest fiends in
hell would not keep company with Wilkes, and then
begged Satan’s pardon for comparing them together.</p>

<p>Lord Temple had got no intelligence of this bomb,
and knew little what to say; but concluding, justly,
that the piece had been found among Wilkes’s papers,
condemned the means by which it was obtained. It
was instantly voted blasphemous, and a breach of privilege
against the person of the Bishop of Gloucester.
Lord Sandwich then moved that Wilkes should be
voted the author; but even Lord Mansfield condemned
so hasty and arbitrary a course, and said it was previously
necessary to hear the accused person in his own
defence: on which the proceeding was adjourned to
the next day but one. I was in a division in the lobby
of the House of Commons, when I heard what was
passing in the other House, and immediately informed
Mr. Pitt. He replied with indignation, “Why do
not they search the Bishop of Gloucester’s study for
heresy?”</p>

<p>Events now thickened so fast, that to avoid confusion,
I will here say a little more on this head. The
plot so hopefully laid to blow up Wilkes, and ruin
him in the estimation of all the decent and grave, had,
at least in the latter respect, scarce any effect at all.
The treachery was so gross and scandalous, so revengeful,
and so totally unconnected with the political
conduct of Wilkes, and the instruments so despicable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
odious, or in whom any pretensions to decency, sanctimony,
or faith, were so preposterous, that losing all
sight of the scandal contained in the poem, the whole
world almost united in crying out against the informers.
Sandwich, in opening the discovery, had
canted till his own friends could not keep their countenances.
Sir Francis Dashwood was not more notorious
for singing profane and lewd catches; and what
aggravated the hypocrisy, scarce a fortnight had passed
since this holy Secretary of State himself had been
present with Wilkes at a weekly club to which both
belonged, held at the top of Covent Garden Theatre,
and composed of players and the loosest revellers of
the age. Warburton’s part was only ridiculous, and
was heightened by its being known that Potter, his
wife’s gallant, had had the chief hand in the composition
of the verses. However, an intimacy commenced
between the Bishop and Sandwich, and some
jovial dinners and libations of champagne cemented
their friendship. Kidgell, the jackall, published so
precise, affected, and hypocritic an account of the
transaction, that he, who might have escaped in the
gloom of the treachery, completely blasted his own reputation;
and falling into debt, was, according to the
fate of inferior tools, abandoned by his masters, and
forced to fly his country. Though the rank and fortune
of Sandwich saved him from disgrace of that
kind, he had little reason to exult in his machination.
He brought a stigma on himself that counterworked
many of his own views and arts; and Churchill the
poet has branded his name on this account with lasting
colours. The public indignation went so far, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
Beggar’s Opera being performed at Covent Garden
Theatre soon after this event, the whole audience,
when Macheath says, “<em>That Jemmy Twitcher should
peach me, I own surprises me</em>,” burst out into an applause
of application; and the nick-name of <em>Jemmy
Twitcher</em> stuck by the Earl so as almost to occasion
the disuse of his title.</p>

<p>While the destruction of the character and fortune
of Wilkes was thus prosecuted in one chamber of Parliament,
a plot against his life was hatching in the
other; his enemies not being satisfied with all the severities
they could wring from the law to oppress him.
Nor were several servants of the Crown sorry to make
his outrages a handle for curtailing liberty itself. The
House was no sooner met, than Wilkes rose to make
his complaint of the breach of privilege in the seizure
of himself and his papers. The Speaker interrupted
him, and said the session was not yet open, the silly
form of reading a bill not having been gone through.
Grenville, too, urged that there was a message from
the Crown that ought to be received before any other
business. Beckford and Onslow pleaded that privilege
ought to take place of every other consideration.
A long and warm debate ensued. Mr. Pitt strenuously
supported the precedence of privilege, though affecting
to offer to take privilege and message together.
Elliot moved to have a bill read. Pitt replied admirably,
and said, if they were not yet a House, no member
could have been sworn; nor was it necessary to
have some nonsense read to which nobody would attend.
Suppose it should have been forgotten, and the
House had entered on some arduous business, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
fool of form might have started up and told them,—“Lord
bless us! it is all a nullity that we have been
doing!” Privilege waived would really nullify the proceedings.
The House would be a company of men put
under force. The man who would waive privilege
ought to have a question moved on him. Lord North,
Nugent, and Dyson argued against privilege, and
warm words passed between Pitt on one side, Grenville
and Norton on the other. Yorke said, that if they
did not begin regularly with a bill, Westminster Hall
would not know how to date the commencement of
the session, unless the two Houses started together.
Pitt replied, that if the House should sit till three in
the morning, it would still be deemed the 15th of
November. The House divided at six in the evening,
and it was carried, by 300 to 111, that a bill should
first be read. Grenville then delivered the message
from the Crown, acquainting the House with the imprisonment
that had been made of one of their members;
for which message Lord North moved the
thanks of the House; together with an assurance that
they would forthwith go into the consideration of the
offence. Wilkes then made his complaint. Mr. Pitt
approved of Lord North’s motion of thanks, but spoke
against precipitation. Wilkes’s case, he said, was not to
be paralleled. He desired to be tried by his peers,—and
if he did not, said Pitt, I would force him. The North
Briton No. 45 was then read; and two printers being
examined, one said he had received it from Wilkes in
his own hand-writing; the other, that Wilkes and
Churchill were the authors of that periodic paper in
general. Lord North, who had undertaken the conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
of the parliamentary prosecution against Wilkes,
held forth on the sedition of those papers, and of No.
45 in particular. Wilkes replied, his Lordship, however,
had not proved that it contained any falsehoods.
Mr. Pitt said it was a scandalous, licentious paper, and
false; but always distinguishing between the criminal
and the illegal proceedings of the Ministers. The
House, he said, was not a proper place for trying a
libel; nor did this tend to excite traitorous insurrections.
Was the motion calculated, by inserting the
word <em>traitorous</em>, to justify what the Ministers had done?
He himself could never learn exactly what was a libel.
Whoever was the patron of these doctrines, fœnum
habet in cornu. Norton said he did think the paper
tended to excite insurrections. Scandalous reflections
on private men or magistrates were a libel. Opposing
law was treason. Pitt replied, a libel could not be
treason. It might, said North, tend to excite treason.
Pitt moved to omit the epithet <em>traitorous</em>, but
the Ministry upholding it, the House divided at eleven
at night, and the ministerial phrase was carried by 273
against 111; Sir Alexander Gilmour and Murray,
two Scots, and the only two of that nation in opposition,
voting with the rest of their countrymen on that
occasion. Lord North then moved to have the paper
burned by the hangman, which was ordered. Lord
North affirmed next, that privilege did not extend to
libels, nor to stay justice; which Pitt said was the
boldest assertion and attempt ever made without consulting
precedents or appointing a committee. He
lamented the King was so ill served as to run aground
on the liberties of Parliament. He would die, he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
if a day were not appointed for hearing Wilkes. Norton
took this up hotly, and said he was called upon by
insult and abuse. Pitt replied, that he had said the
King had been ill served by lawyers and others; and
he proposed to take the case of privilege into consideration
the next day, and on the following day to hear
the complaint of Wilkes; which was agreed to at one
in the morning.</p>

<p>The next day when I went down to the House, I
found all the members standing on the floor in great
hubbub, questioning, hearing, and eagerly discussing I
knew not what. I soon learned that Wilkes about
two hours before had been dangerously wounded by
Martin in a duel. In the foregoing spring, Wilkes, in
one of his North Britons, had pointed out Martin by
name as a low fellow, and dirty tool of power. Martin
had stomached, not digested this; but in the debate
on No. 45 the day before, he had risen and called the
author of that paper on himself a cowardly, scandalous,
and malignant scoundrel, and had repeated the words
twice, trembling with rage. Wilkes took no notice;
and as he did not, the House did not interfere, as is
usual, when personalities happen, and seem to threaten
a duel. The next morning Wilkes wrote to Martin,
to ask if the words used the day before were meant to
be addressed to him as the supposed author of the
paper in which Martin had been abused. If Martin
had thus intended to point the words, Wilkes owned
he had written that paper. Martin replied, he had
meant him, Wilkes; and as the latter had avowed
himself the author, he should not deny, added Martin,
what he had said before five hundred people, and gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
him a challenge. About noon they went into Hyde-park;
Martin alone; Wilkes, with Humphrey Cotes<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a>
in a post-chaise, knowing if he killed Martin that he
should have no chance of pardon. Cotes waited at a
distance. They changed pistols, both fired, and both
missed. Martin fired a second time, and lodged a ball
in Wilkes’s side, who was going to fire, but dropped his
pistol. The wound, though not mortal, proved a bad one.</p>

<p>It was thought an ill symptom of Martin’s heroism,
that he had smothered the affront for so many months,
nor had given vent to his resentment, till the affair
with Forbes had left a doubt on Wilkes’s courage. If
Martin got rid of this imputation, it was but at the
expense of a worse charge. It came out, nor could he
deny it, that his neighbours in the country had observed
him practising to fire at a target for the whole
summer. I shall not be thought to have used too hard
an expression, when I called this a plot against the
life of Wilkes. Churchill wrote <cite>The Duellist</cite>, one of
his finest satires, on this occasion.</p>

<p>On the 16th, the King’s speech was read to the
Commons, when Lord Caernarvon<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> and Lord Frederick
Campbell moved the Address. Pitt made an obscure
speech, parts of which seemed to aim at explaining his
conduct in the late negotiation; but all that could be
gathered from it was, that he had not excommunicated
the Peace-makers, nor the Tories; that he had aimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
most at Lord Mansfield, and that he took up the Whigs,
but not as enemies to prerogative.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> He could not
allow, he said, the words <em>safe and honourable Peace</em> in
the Address; he did not think it was either; it was
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">durante bene placito</i> of France and Spain: yet as the
Address precluded nobody from speaking their sentiment
afterwards, he should let the words pass. For
himself, no minister could know less what to do with
the Peace; nor did any man more bid adieu to the
political world than he did. He was against reviving
party-names; but if dissension arose on principles, he
must again become a party-man. Grenville taking
hold of Beckford’s objecting to the proclamation for
settling America, made artful advantage of the opportunity
to show the great pains taken by the Ministry
to settle our conquests and colonies, and to regulate
the finances at home. In one article they had struck
off 250,000<i>l.</i> of the demands made from Germany.
He then expatiated on the profusion of the war, and
attacked Pitt strongly without reserve or fear. The
Address was voted without a negative.</p>

<p>The farther hearing on Wilkes was deferred on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
account of his wound.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> After the debate Pitt had a
meeting with the Dukes of Newcastle, Devonshire,
and their friends, and insisted on their supporting
Chief Justice Pratt’s opinion in behalf of privilege
against Mr. Yorke, who had declared that Wilkes’s
case was not within the pale of privilege.</p>

<p>During these transactions, the King, after keeping
the bishoprick of Osnabrugh open near three years,
contrary to the custom, which allows but six months,
bestowed it on his son, a new-born child,<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> before it
was christened. The Duke of York<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> had thought it
his due, and not without reason. It could not be conferred
on the Prince of Wales; nor was there much
equity in reserving it for a son that might be born.
The interest of the family and of the Protestant cause,
too, seemed to point out the Duke, as an infant liable
to so many accidents might, if born, soon fail, and
then the turn would revolve to the Papists; even a
minor in possession was favourable too, to that party,
for of the revenue, which is about 25,000<i>l.</i> a year,
only 2000<i>l.</i> belong to the Bishop till he is eighteen,
and the rest is divided amongst the Popish chapter.
But the Queen, who began to get weight with her
husband in German affairs, prevailed to reserve for,
and then to grant this great provision to, a child of her
own; and the Duke of York’s little reverence for his
mother, and antipathy to the Favourite, excluded him
from a grace for which he had so much occasion.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of November came on the important
question whether the Privilege of Parliament preserved
the members from being taken up for writing and publishing
libels. At first sight, a disinterested person
would perhaps think it strange that it should be a question
whether a seat in the Legislature should not secure
the Legislators from the penalty of breaking the laws,
for publishing a libel is undoubtedly illegal; but to
those acquainted with our Constitution, it will perhaps
appear more extraordinary that a House of Commons
should suffer such a question to be proposed to them,
and that they should condescend to agitate it. Will
our posterity believe that a House of Commons gave
it up? but it was <em>that</em> House of Commons that had
sold itself to approve the late Peace. Still it is to be
admired that this cessation of their privileges should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
be wrung from them, after the Court of Common
Pleas had declared that Privilege held against everything
but treason, felony, and breach of the peace. A
libel, at most, but <em>tended</em> to a breach of the peace.</p>

<p>The Legislature consists of the three branches of
Kings, Lords, and Commons. Together they form our
invaluable Constitution, and each is a check on the
other two. But it must be remembered, at the same
time, that while any two are checking, the third is
naturally aiming at extending and aggrandizing its
power. The House of Commons has not seldom made
this attempt, like the rest. The Lords, as a permanent
and as a proud body, more constantly aim at it: the
Crown always. Of liberty, a chief and material engine
is the liberty of the Press: a privilege for ever sought
to be stifled and annihilated by the Crown. The ministers
of the Crown and its lawyers must misrepresent
the liberty of the Press before they can presume to
request the suppression of it. Every grievance set
forth in print is misnamed a libel; and grave laws
necessarily disapprove libels. If the Crown can arrive
at precluding Members of Parliament from complaining
in print of grievances, no doubt the Crown could
debar all other men, who are of less importance, and
whose persons are guarded by no sacred privilege.
Liberty of speech and liberty of writing are the two
instruments by which Englishmen call on one another
to defend their common rights. Liberty of speech is
communicated but a little way; the Press gives wings
to that voice, and all men may read what all cannot
hear. Freedom of speech in Parliament is not so
valuable as freedom of writing. A man may hazard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
many necessary truths in print, when he may conceal
his name, which he might not venture to utter in open
Parliament. If discovered, his privilege used to be his
security. Nor is this a vindication of libels, properly
so called; but a Court will call a libel the most just
censure of tyranny. Yet could it not wrest from
Members of Parliament the safety of their persons
without their own consent—and in what instance did
the Court ask this?—in what instance did the House
of Commons yield it? Mr. Wilkes, one of their own
members, had been taken up by a <em>General Warrant</em>,
in which his name had not so much as been mentioned.
Contrary to all precedent, he had been committed
<em>close</em> prisoner to the Tower—a proceeding so arbitrary,
that a Court of Law had set him free. The
House of Commons sacrificed him and their own privileges,
and yet shame—I mean disgrace, so soon overtook
them, that <em>General Warrants</em>, such as that on
which Wilkes was arrested, were given up, condemned,
exploded—but half the wound remains, for
this scandalous vote was never rescinded!</p>

<p>It is true, that on the debate it did appear that there
were many and many precedents on both sides. Often
had privilege protected a member—often it had not;
but how did that happen to be the case? It happened,
because there had been various cases in which
the Crown was not concerned, but where the contest
had lain between subject and subject; and in those
instances the House had often determined different
ways. But on the great case of the seven Bishops, in
the reign of James the Second, Privilege of Parliament
had been vindicated and secured. What would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
become of those prelates if the Court had had this
precedent of Wilkes to justify its violence? Even
allowing that privilege were not inherent in members,
but had been decided sometimes for, sometimes against
them; was this a time—was this an instance, in which
the House should have waived its pretensions? Was
the blow it gave itself likely to be repaired? But let
the preceding and subsequent conduct of this ductile
and servile House of Commons tell its motives!</p>

<p>The debates were not brilliant, but serious and solemn
as the occasion required. Lord North<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> was the
chief manager for the Court, supported by Norton,
George Grenville, Morton,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> and Elliot. Lord North’s
mouthing and boisterous manner, his coarse figure, and
rude untempered style, contributed to make the cause
into which he had unnecessarily thrust himself appear
still more odious. Pitt, Beckford, Legge, Sir George
Saville, Sir William Baker, and James Grenville defended
the Constitution. Much was said on the danger
to which every man’s private papers were now exposed,
and more on the injustice of hurrying on this decision,
when Wilkes could not for his wound appear to defend
himself, when he was prosecuting both the Secretaries
of State and the messengers, and when he was to be
tried himself for the libel. What court, what judge,
what jury, but must be prejudiced by a decision of the
House of Commons against him? This plea was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
glaring, was crying. The lawyers themselves many of
them allowed it, and the debate took that turn; the
Opposition endeavouring to stave off the question on
Privilege, the courtiers insisting to bring it on. Charles
Yorke begged for delay, but it was a delay of a few
days; Eliab Harvey, though bred a Tory, pleaded for
deferring their decision. Forester, a Scot devoted to
the Duke of Bedford,<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> and reckoned no squeamish
lawyer, spoke for procrastination, and voted against
the Court. Wedderburne, another Scot, argued for
farther time; and even old Wilbraham,<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> the Gamaliel
of the Jacobites, could not digest such indecent hurry,
for which he was much commended by Pitt; yet by
seven in the evening the Court bore down all obstruction,
and carried their point by 243 to 166; though
Sir John Philipps and Benjamin Bathurst,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> two high-prerogative
men, were in the minority, with Glover,
and four general officers—Conway, Sir John Griffin,<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
A’Court,<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> and Honeywood.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> It being, however, too
late to commence the regular debate, it was adjourned
till the next day.</p>

<p>The 24th, a letter from Wilkes was presented, protesting
against their proceedings, and promising on his
honour to attend in his place as soon as possible. To
this no regard was paid, Grenville moving for the
orders of the day, and Rigby saying that Wilkes could
not have written that letter but on misrepresentation
of what had passed the day before. Hussey, the
Queen’s Solicitor, a man of most fair life, unambitious,
uninterested, candid in his conduct, and gracefully
touching in his delivery, a great friend of Pratt, and
lover of the Constitution, made an excellent speech in
behalf of privilege and liberty. Charles Yorke, under
the difficulties of disgusting his Whig friends and of
serving a Court with which he was dissatisfied, explored
all the sources of distinction and law subtleties,
to defend his opinion against privilege; and spoke for
two hours with great applause, as excellent in that
branch of his profession. Pitt, near as long on the
audaciousness of the Crown’s servants, and their contempt
of Parliament; declaring that this proceeding
was making a surrender from that day of every man’s
liberty in the House to the discretion of the Secretary
of State. Pitt was ill, and then went away. Norton
indecently quoted a prosecution for perjury against Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
John Rushout,<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> the most ancient member of the
House, then sitting at the end of the same bench.
The old gentleman was stout and choleric: the prosecution
had been on a case of election, and he had been
acquitted. He rose with warmth, but with much
propriety told his story; showed the prosecution had
been instigated by Norton himself, to serve an election
purpose; and, looking defiance at that attorney, said,
“It was all owing to that <em>honest</em> gentleman!—I hope I
do not call him out of his name!” The shout of the
House did justice on Norton.</p>

<p>This interlude, however, was decent and calm in
comparison of what followed. Rigby, looking at Lord
Temple, who was sitting at the end of the House, to
hear the debate, as he constantly practised, drew a
picture of that incendiary peer, described him in his
blue riband encouraging mobs from windows of coffee-houses;
and more particularly as the instigator of
Wilkes. James Grenville rose, in amazing heat, to
defend his brother, and vomited out a torrent of invectives
on Rigby, telling him of his interestedness
and ignorance; harangued on so illiterate a man being
a Master of the Rolls;<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> and painted his flying from
Ireland to avoid being hanged by the enraged populace.
This philippic was uttered with every vehemence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
of language and gesture; the bitterest terms
flowing spontaneously from him, who had ever been
the most obscure and unready speaker: and what
added to the outrage of the diction was, that sitting
on the bench immediately above Rigby, and dashing
about his arm in the air, he seemed to aim blows at
the latter, who was forced to crouch lest he should
receive them. Grenville had no sooner finished, than
the Speaker interposed—indeed of the latest. Rigby
replied, with ease enough, that in Ireland the Mastership
of the Rolls was a sinecure, and a man as ignorant
as he was might execute the office. The House then
insisted on their giving their words that this altercation
should have no consequences. Grenville, sitting
obstinate and mute, Rigby gave his word it should end
there; and then Grenville in like manner.</p>

<p>The candour of Wilbraham and Philipps on the preceding
day had satisfied their consciences, and they
both now spoke, and voted with the majority. The
House dividing at one in the morning, 258 voted for
relinquishing their privilege; only 133 for maintaining
it. Lord North then moved to communicate their
resolutions to the Lords, which was agreed to.</p>

<p>A conference being accordingly demanded, and held
next day, the Lords, though in a very thin House, and
though no important business is agitated there without
summoning the Peers [a respect their Lordships have
often paid even to a turnpike-bill], were precipitately
proceeding to pass the like votes with the Commons;
but the Duke of Richmond, though acting with the
Court, was struck with the indecency, and on stating
it, the House did agree to summon the Lords for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
29th. Decency thus satisfied, their Lordships on the
29th, in happy harmony with the other House, made
a parallel compliment of their privilege to the Crown.
One hundred and fourteen were thus loyal: the Duke
of Cumberland and thirty-four more were the minority.
The Duke of Newcastle defended the warrant of the
Secretaries, but voted against the resolutions. The
Chancellor<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> was very warm; said he did not wish to
see the House unanimous; unanimity had cost the
nation sixty millions.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> Lord Temple disculpated himself
from encouraging the general satire in the North
Britons, and said he had always condemned the attack
on the Scotch and on the Tories in that paper. He
brought a protest, drawn, as was supposed, by Lord
Chief Justice Pratt, and the longest on record, and
signed it with fifteen other Lords.</p>

<p>At this very period that Court and Parliament were
raging so hotly against libels, a new paper, called the
Moderator, appeared. It was so scurrilous against the
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, that his Court
took up the printer. The man owned directly that it
was written by Carteret Webbe, Solicitor of the Treasury,
and by Dr. Shebbeare, who, having been committed
to Newgate by the King’s Bench in the late
reign for abusing King William and the House of
Hanover, had been gratified by a pension of 200<i>l.</i>
a year by Lord Bute; and was a proper champion of
measures so dissonant from those of King William, and
from those to which the House of Hanover owed the
Crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Lord Clive had last year been thrown out of his
directorship of the East India Company by the intrigues
of Fox; and the new directors had gone so far as to
deprive him of his jaguire, a revenue of 25,000<i>l.</i> a year
conferred on him by the Nabob. This act had driven
Lord Clive, with five members brought into Parliament
by him, into opposition. Grenville, to gain a man so
important, promised that vast revenue should be restored
to him, or an equivalent given; but Walsh, one
of the five, said he could not in conscience vote with
such iniquitous men, and offered to vacate his seat:
Lord Clive refusing to accept it, Walsh abstained from
attendance on the House.</p>

<p>The 3rd of December had been appointed for burning
the North Briton at the Royal Exchange; but
when the magistrates were assembled for that purpose,
and the executioner began to perform the ceremony, a
great riot ensued, the paper was forced from the hangman,
the constables were pelted and beaten, and Mr.
Harley,<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> one of the sheriffs, had the glass of his coach
broken, and himself was wounded in the face by a
billet snatched from the fire that was lighted to burn
the paper, and thrown at him. The cry was “Wilkes
and liberty!” A jack-boot and a petticoat—the mob’s
hieroglyphics for Lord Bute and the Princess, were
burned with great triumph and acclamations.</p>

<p>On the 6th the Duke of Bedford, who had moved
that the Commons might be desired to permit Mr.
Harley, member for the City, to attend the House of
Lords, called on him, and Blount, the other sheriff, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
give an account of the late riot. They said the mob
had been encouraged by gentlemen from windows and
balconies, particularly from the Union coffee-house.
One low man had been taken into custody; another
had been rescued by the rioters. One witness said the
mob had united two respectable names in a cry of
approbation, those of the Duke of Cumberland and
Lord Temple, and he had joined in that shout. The
Duke of Grafton shrewdly told the marshal’sman he
must have seen many mobs of party against party;
had there appeared two parties on this occasion? “No,”
replied the fellow, “all were of one mind.” The Duke
of Bedford, sputtering with zeal and indiscretion, broke
forth against Bridgen, the Lord Mayor, and the other
magistrates, who, though within hearing, had taken no
pains to quell the mob. “Such behaviour,” he said,
“in any smaller town would have forfeited their franchises.
The Common Council had long been setting
themselves up against the Parliament, and last year
had taken on them to advise the King to refuse his
assent to a law<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> that had passed through both Houses.
He hoped their Lordships would resent this insult and
disrespect to their orders.” The Chancellor, alarmed
at this injudicious attack on the City, said it would be
right to proceed without delay against the actors and
abettors of the riot; but without farther proofs, he
would not believe the magistrates of London guilty.
He moved to vote the rioters perturbators of the peace.
This was voted, and thanks to the sheriffs for their
behaviour. The Duke of Richmond seconded the Duke
of Bedford in his violence against the City, and in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
proposal of offering rewards for discovery of the ringleaders,
and for committees of inquiry. Lord Mansfield
and Lord Lyttelton interposed to disculpate the magistrates,
and obtained to adjourn; the former saying, that
no doubt the magistrates were actually at that time
sifting to the bottom of the commotion. The Lords
then conferred with the House of Commons, where
Rigby tried to propagate his master’s<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> spirit, and to get
the Lord Mayor censured; but, on reflection, the ministers
chose to pass over the insult, rather than quarrel
seriously with the City of London. They all, therefore,
concurred to excuse the magistracy; and the affair was
dropped in an address to the King to order the offenders
to be brought to justice.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></p>

<p>The Common Council, neither intimidated nor imitating
the moderation of Parliament, put a negative on
a motion for thanking the sheriffs, and for prosecuting
Franklin, the fellow apprehended in the tumult.</p>

<p>Wilkes, in the meantime, went on triumphantly with
his prosecutions; and on the 6th of December, obtained
a verdict of 1000<i>l.</i> damages, and costs of suit,
against Mr. Wood, the Under-Secretary of State.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></p>

<p>The Court was exerting its authority on the other
hand. Lord Shelburne was dismissed from being aide-de-camp
to the King; Colonel Barré from being Adjutant-general
and Governor of Stirling Castle; and Calcraft
lost some little places, which served to provoke
more than to hurt him.</p>

<p>The Chevalier d’Eon, the mimic of Wilkes, was less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
fortunate. Being recalled by his Court, and refusing
to return, he was declared to be no longer employed
here in a public character, and was accordingly forbidden
to appear at St. James’s.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p>While the world was anxiously expecting the event
of Wilkes’s affair, protracted by his wound, a new
alarm was given of an intention to murder him. Mr.
Onslow on the 9th acquainted the House of Commons
that one Alexander Dun, a Scotchman, had on
false pretences got into Mr. Wilkes’s house the night
before, intending to assassinate him. A person who
appeared, and made oath that he had heard this Dun
declare that he and twelve more had made a vow to
murder Wilkes, had given notice to the latter of their
design, on which he had prepared persons to seize the
assassin, which they had done. A new penknife was
found upon him, and he prevaricated on the time and
place of buying it. The House the next day examined
witnesses on this accusation; but it being proved that
Dun had been discharged from a ship as a lunatic, he
was dismissed out of custody. But the multitude
were far from not continuing to believe the plot (nor
indeed was a madman an improper subject to be set
on, if there was such a design), and the animosity
against the Scotch was accordingly augmented. About
the same time the printers of the North Briton obtained
in the Court of Common Pleas damages to the
amount of four hundred pounds against the messengers
of the Secretary’s office.</p>

<p>The East India Company were untractable, too, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
came to an unanimous resolution of neither restoring
his jaguire to Lord Clive, nor of allowing him three
hundred thousand pounds, which the ministry had
engaged to obtain for him in lieu of it. It occasioned
much diversion that his father, an old unfashioned
man, who did not understand how decently corruption
was practised, and how ridiculous it is to talk of what
few are ashamed of doing, being asked by the King, in
the drawing-room, where his son Lord Clive was, replied,
with all the honesty of bargain and sale, “He is
coming to town, Sir, and then your Majesty will have
another vote.”</p>

<p>The House of Commons having ordered that Wilkes
should appear before them on the 24th, and suspecting
that his delays were affected, Lord North, George
Grenville, and Rigby, in a very thin House, proposed
that Dr. Heberden, and Mr. Hawkins the surgeon,
should be ordered to attend him. This was warmly
opposed; and Charles Townshend, who knew that Pitt
was provoked at his late silence, and who saw Grenville
and North towering above him, and perhaps
offended too that the Court seemed to despise him,
broke out with much vehemence, turned Lord North
into ridicule, and being told by Grenville that it would
be wiser to submit to this motion, replied, he should
often differ with that gentleman, and hoped he should
not have more wisdom to encounter than he had met
with that day. The motion was carried by 71 to 30.
Wilkes, however, would not admit the parliamentary
physician and surgeon; and, to add mockery to disobedience,
sent for Doctors Duncan and Middleton, two
Scotchmen. He had at first, at Martin’s request, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
fled to Calais till Wilkes was out of danger consulted
both Hawkins and Heberden. Being told that he
must see little company for fear of augmenting his
fever, he said, “I will not see so much as my own
wife,”—I had mentioned that they were parted.</p>

<p>It was to the no small satisfaction of the Ministry
that on the 26th they heard that Wilkes was privately
gone off to France. It was a sort of confession of
guilt, disburthened them of the odium of punishing
him personally, and left them at liberty to rage against
him by outlawry and forfeitures. With a proper executioner
they had just provided themselves, having
raised Norton to be Attorney-General. He was succeeded
as Solicitor by De Grey,<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> a man of a fair character
and moderate principles.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang b2">Lord Sandwich’s unpopularity.—He offers himself for the High
Stewardship of Cambridge.—Animosity between him and Lord
Royston, the other candidate.—Lord Sandwich’s “Flying Pension.”—Disgraceful
Grant to Count Virri.—Dismissal of General
A’Court.—Grenville, Walpole, and General Conway.</p></blockquote>

<p>The effects of Lord Sandwich’s conduct began
already to be felt. He having, to thwart the Duke
of Cumberland, who espoused Mr. Luther, taken the
opposite side on the election for the county of Essex,<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a>
the Court lost the election by dint of Sandwich’s unpopularity.
He himself, foreseeing the approaching
death of Lord Hardwicke, presented himself as candidate
for the High Stewardship of Cambridge. Nothing
could occasion greater ridicule than a character
so flagitious offered to a religious and learned society.
It counter-worked even his own indefatigable industry.
Lord Royston,<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> son of Lord Hardwicke, was the other
candidate; and the animosities ran so high, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
two parties preached against each other. The sequel
will appear hereafter. In the meantime Sandwich obtained
what was called a <em>flying pension</em>, that is, it was
to commence if he lost his place. The grant was of
3000<i>l.</i> a year on Ireland; but when the order went
to Dublin, Lord Northumberland, having promised
that no addition should be made to the pension-list
during his administration, was forced to represent so
strongly against what was granted to Lord Sandwich,
that the Court was obliged to recall it. The Irish
House of Commons had just then set itself to examine
the state of pensions charged on that country, and it
had been found, as they published to the world in their
votes, that since the commencement of this reign, a
period only of three years, 17,000<i>l.</i> a year had been
added to that list. There likewise appeared the disgraceful
grant to Count Virri, the purchase of the
peace. It stood in the name of one Charles.</p>

<p>The year concluded with the dismission of General
A’Court, whose regiment was taken from him for having
voted for the Privilege of Parliament. The man
was obscure and of no importance, had a large family
and no fortune;<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> the tyranny therefore was the more
flagrant, but from those very circumstances made the
less noise. Lord Sandwich had carried into the King
a list of sixteen officers who had dared to act with
spirit and independence against the arbitrary measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
of the Court. The poor man in question was selected
for an example of terror; but, except in his ruin, the
ministers found no cause to exult. A much more
considerable man had taken the same part, of which it
is necessary here to give some account.</p>

<p>I have said that General Conway,<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> under pretence
of bringing home the troops, had been kept abroad till
the peace was voted, the ministers apprehending that
they should not be able to influence him to approve
an event so ruinous and shameful to his country. At
his return, no man being less factious, he had entered
into no cabals, had attached himself to no party. His
chief friendships were with the Duke of Devonshire,
with his own brother the Earl of Hertford, and with
me. The Duke, though grievously insulted and provoked,
was of so decent and cautious a nature, that he
was the last man on earth to think of exciting his
friends to violent measures; and, indeed, after the first
sally of passion, bore his affront with too much patience.
Lord Hertford was a perfect courtier, and more likely
to dissuade his brother from, than incite him to, Opposition.
I, much more inclined to party-heat, had been
very seriously alarmed at the strides I had seen
made towards arbitrary power; but having beheld the
cowardice of Lord Bute, and knowing that of Lord
Mansfield, and finding the nation delivered from the
influence of Fox, I had flattered myself the danger
was over. I had been pleased, too, that Grenville was
become the acting minister; having (I confess my
blindness) entertained a most favourable opinion of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
integrity. He talked nothing but reformation—which,
indeed, alone, would not have duped me—I had seen too
much of patriot hypocrisy! but he went beyond myself
in his principles of liberty—I mean, in his discourse.
I thought him a grounded Republican; had heard
him harangue by the hour against the despotic doctrines
of Lord Mansfield. Nor had his venal prostitution
of himself to Lord Bute as yet opened my eyes.
But I was again roused by the arbitrary treatment of
Wilkes, committed close prisoner to the Tower by an
indefinite warrant. Lord Bute, I saw, had left his
cloak to his successors; yet I could not believe that
my friend, Algernon Sydney, (for Grenville appeared
to me as scarce a less Whig saint,) was capable of
concurring in such measures. In truth, when I saw
Saint Sandwich added to his rubric, I began to be
startled. I saw him lean, too, on the Bedfords: them
I did not love: and nothing is a more sovereign cure
for blindness in friendship, than a connection between
one’s friends and one’s enemies. I laboured by those
most in Grenville’s confidence to detach him from so
disreputable an union; but Grenville knew his interest
better than I knew him. Still I had not the most
distant suspicion of what his heart was capable of,
nor any view of opposing his administration. Thinking
him as frank and candid as myself, and thoroughly
shocked at the use made of General Warrants, I desired
Mr. Thomas Pitt,<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> attached to Mr. Grenville, and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
own friend, to tell him fairly in the summer, that I
believed I should differ with him when the point of
General Warrants should be agitated in Parliament.
But not content with opposing them myself, I earnestly
desired that Mr. Conway should take the same
step: and in bringing that about, I by no means piqued
myself on the same frankness. Should Lord Hertford
conceive the least suspicion of my intentions, I knew
how sedulously he would labour to prevent his brother
from involving himself against the Court. He might
procure Mr. Conway to be again sent aside on some
honourable commission, or contrive to have his gratitude
dipped in favours from the King, before he should
be aware with what view they were bestowed. I
waited therefore in silence and patience till Lord
Hertford was set out on his embassy to Paris, before I
ever named the term <em>General Warrants</em> in the presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
of Mr. Conway. Then, indeed, I asked him, as by
accident, how he intended to vote on that business,
telling him I should wish to act as he did. I found
he was disgusted at the Warrants; and thence I easily
entered into agreement with him to oppose them, as
we did, no other person living having any previous
intimation of his intention. The Court was alarmed;
and Grenville sent Mr. Thomas Pitt to me to sound
me on that head; both of them believing that I had
rather been influenced by Conway, than he by me.</p>

<p>Pitt began with Mr. Grenville’s concern at Mr.
Conway’s behaviour, wished to know what had disgusted
him, and was ready to obtain for him whatever
his warmest wishes could aim at. I assured him he
was thoroughly mistaken; that no disgust had taken
possession of Mr. Conway; that no man was less ambitious;
and that I advised Mr. Grenville, as a friend,
not to think of treating Mr. Conway as a man to be
bought. <em>That</em> really would disgust him, and might
throw him into Opposition, of which I was sure at present
he had no thoughts,—and thus far I really spoke
with good wishes to Mr. Grenville,—but the scene
soon changed. Finding bribes rejected, Pitt altered
his tone: said it could not be suffered to have men in
the King’s service acting against him,—and then dropped
this unguarded expression, <em>the King could not trust
his army in such hands</em>. I started. “Good God!” said
I, “Mr. Pitt, what are they going to do with the army?
to what use is it to be put, if a man of Mr. Conway’s
virtue, and tried loyalty and bravery, cannot be trusted
with a regiment? You alarm me!” He beat about
backwards and forwards: sometimes it was offers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
promises, sometimes threats; but I had taken my part,
and had got hold of words I was determined not to
part with or forget. I would say no more, but that I
advised Mr. Grenville to have patience; that I knew
Mr. Conway neither was in, nor was going into, Opposition
(for they were jealous of his connection with the
Duke of Devonshire), and that I was sure he would
never be influenced, would never act but from principle;
and if they would leave him to himself they
would have no reason to be dissatisfied,—and I told
them the truth, if they had had sense enough to believe
me. Mr. Pitt then pressed me to talk it over with
Mr. Grenville, which I declined. I said, I would certainly
never give Mr. Conway any dishonourable advice;
would never try to persuade him to be bribed or
terrified; nor would he forgive me if I should. Pitt
persisted. I said, “Mr. Pitt, I am persuaded Mr. Grenville
will never report my conversation differently from
the truth: but though he may not intend it, he may
mistake me; I may mistake him. I will wait on him,
upon condition a third person is present. I do not
desire it may be a friend of mine, and not his: you are
a friend to both; and though justly much more attached
to him than to me, I am persuaded, if any difference
should arise between us in the relation of the interview,
you have too much honour not to do strict justice to
either. If you may be present, I will meet him,—but
remember, I tell you it will be to no purpose.” In truth,
after such a Star-Chamber sentence as <em>the King cannot
trust his army in the hands of a man who votes in Parliament
against him</em>, I was not disposed to labour in cementing
an union between my friend and a man of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
apostate degeneracy. From that hour all my prejudices
in Grenville’s favour were dispelled. I saw how dangerous
he was: it was Fox with a fairer character.</p>

<p>Though I had given too little encouragement to expect
any alteration either in Mr. Conway’s or my own
sentiments, Grenville persisted in the interview. I
went accordingly to Mr. Thomas Pitt’s. It happened
to be the evening of the riot on burning the North
Briton. Grenville arrived in the most ridiculous and
extraordinary disorder I ever saw. He could scarce
articulate for passion. One would have thought the
City had been taken by storm and the guards cut to
pieces. Yet this was not a panic. It was rage to see
authority set at nought while <em>he</em> was minister. His
subsequent conduct gave evidence that this was his
sensation: no man ever bore power with more pride.
For some time I could scarce learn what had provoked
him: the confusion of his ideas made him talk as if
Mr. Conway had raised a rebellion. Commanding my
laughter, and waiting with patience till the torrent
should have spent itself, but to no purpose, I was
forced at last to ask what the riot had to do with Mr.
Conway’s case? This unfortunate question, like snatching
a pebble from amidst a cascade, did but make it
dash at random on all sides. From seven in the evening
till ten at night, I sat to hear his inundation of
words, scarce uttering ten myself; and we parted with
as little fruit as might be expected from a conversation
so intemperate and disjointed; the result of all I
said being to repeat my request that he would have
patience, and assuring him that he would not find Mr.
Conway engaged in any regular opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
Whether it proceeded from his impatience of contradiction,
whether from eagerness to carry his point,
or whether privately instigated by the Bedfords to
push on an explanation which they hoped might drive
Mr. Conway into settled hostilities, or whether, which
I think most likely, they flattered themselves they
should regain him from my influence, Grenville desired
an interview with Conway himself. He consulted
me, and we agreed that he should act as I had
done, and insist on a third person being present, proposing
the Duke of Richmond,<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a> his son-in-law, who
however could not be exceptionable, as he acted uniformly
with the Court. This demand produced a new
scene of ridiculous distress. Though the meeting had
been proposed, and Mr. Conway’s answer sent by noon,
it was not till ten at night that Mr. Grenville could
bring himself to any resolution; being, as his servant
owned, shut up for the greatest part of the time with
his wife,<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> a proud, ambitious, and sensible woman, and
the only person to whom he would listen. She, indeed,
had full dominion over him. The precautions
taken both by Mr. Conway and me had put Grenville
on his guard: not a word dropped from him intimating
bribery. The meeting ended fruitlessly, as we had
foreseen. Conway was naturally cold, and Grenville
far from being master of ingratiating persuasion. Conway
adhered to the declaration that he was engaged in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
no opposition. His subsequent behaviour amply confirmed
that assurance; but a new measure of obedience
was set up, and my late republican friend was
become as strict a disciplinarian as the most arbitrary
of his predecessors.</p>

Brunswick.—His marked opposition to the wishes of the King.—Debates
on Wilkes’s complaint of Breach of Privilege.—Sir William
Meredith and Sir George Saville.—The “Essay on Woman.”—The

<p>So early as in the late reign there had been thoughts
of a double alliance with the ducal house of Brunswick;
but when the jealousy of the Princess Dowager had
prevented the marriage of her son with a princess of
that line, there had remained no great propensity in
the Court of Brunswick to the other match between
the hereditary Prince and Lady Augusta.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> It had,
however, been treated of from time to time; and in
1762 had been agreed, but was abruptly broken off by
the influence of the King of Prussia. Lady Augusta
was lively, and much inclined to meddle in the private
politics of the Court. As none of her children but the
King had, or had reason to have, much affection for
their mother, she justly apprehended Lady Augusta’s
instilling their disgusts into the Queen. She could
not forbid her daughter’s frequent visits at Buckingham
House, but to prevent any ill consequence from them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
often accompanied her thither. This, however, was an
attendance and constraint the Princess of Wales could
not support. Her exceeding indolence, her more
excessive love of privacy, and the subjection of being
frequently with the Queen, whose higher rank was a
never-ceasing mortification, all concurred to make her
resolve at any rate to deliver herself from her daughter.
To attain this end, profusion of favours to the hated
House of Brunswick was not thought too much. The
hereditary Prince was prevailed on to accept Lady
Augusta’s hand, with fourscore thousand pounds, an
annuity of 5000<i>l.</i> a year on Ireland, and 3000<i>l.</i> a year
on Hanover. Fourscore thousand pounds were given
with the late Princess Royal<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> to the Prince of Orange,
but she was a King’s daughter. The Princess Mary<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a>
and Louisa had but forty thousand each.</p>

<p>Lady Augusta was not handsome, but tall enough,
and not ill-made; with the German whiteness of hair
and complexion, so remarkable in the Royal Family,
and with their precipitate, yet thick, Westphalian accent.
She had little grace or softness in her manner:
yet with more attractions she might have failed to
gain a heart that was not inclined to part with its liberty,
and least of all to one of her family. The Prince
arrived on the 12th of January; and, as if to prejudice
him against his bride, the plan was formed to disgust
him as much in order to send him away as soon as
possible. He was lodged at Somerset House: no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
guards were stationed there. The Lord Steward chose
the company that should dine with him: and every
art was used to prevent his seeing Mr. Pitt, or the
chiefs of the Opposition. At the wedding, which
was on the 16th, the servants of the King and Queen
were ordered not to appear in new clothes. But
though these little artifices had the desired effect of
affronting the Prince, they only drew mortifications on
the Court. The people, enchanted with novelty and
a hero, were unbounded in their exultations wherever
he appeared; and, as the behaviour of the Court got
wind, took pleasure, when he attended the King to
the theatres, to mark their joy at the presence of the
Prince, and to show the coldest neglect of their Sovereign.
Nor was the Prince less assiduous to intimate
his dissatisfaction, even to ill-breeding, turning his
back to the King, as he stood over against him in the
box at the Opera; and even going away during half
the representation. To the Duke of Newcastle, and
others in disgrace, he was full of attentions; dined
twice with the Duke of Cumberland, and affectedly
lingered there, though the King and Queen waited for
him to a ball: and, as he found <em>that</em> step would be the
most offensive, though indeed due from him to one so
partial to his family, he made a visit to Mr. Pitt, at
Hayes.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> These little hostilities were carried on with
such vigour on both sides, that, notwithstanding all his
curiosity and desires expressed of a longer stay, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
King forced him and his bride to depart on the 25th—only
thirteen days after his arrival. They were overtaken
in a great storm at sea, and in extreme danger
of being lost; but escaped, not only with good fortune
to themselves, but to the Court of England, who would
have appeared as guilty to the people in driving them
out at such a season, as if they had raised the tempest
by sorcery.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></p>

<p>The Parliament having reassembled on Jan. 16th,
the House of Commons on the 19th proceeded on the
affair of Wilkes. He had given out that he would
return from Paris, and make his defence: and to carry
on the delusion, a dinner was bespoken, and company
invited to meet him; but on the day destined for
deciding his fate, a letter from him was delivered to
the Speaker, accompanied by a certificate from two
French surgeons, attesting his incapacity of travelling
from the ill state of his wound. The Court party<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
objected even to the reading of the certificates, but
though they could not prevent it, so eager was the
curiosity of the House, they did frustrate a motion for
adjournment by 239 to 102; on which many of the
minority finding their weakness left the House. Others
battled for the criminal till near four in the morning,
but their numbers still dwindling away, Wilkes was
at last expelled with scarce a negative, the warmest
sticklers for him having been discountenanced and
discouraged by the harsh epithets bestowed on him
by Pitt in one of the former debates.</p>

<p>The next day Sir William Meredith and Sir George
Saville moved to have Wilkes’s complaint of breach
of privilege examined. George Grenville tried to
evade it, but was strongly attacked by Charles Townshend,
and reproached with the dismission of General
A’Court, and with the arbitrary influence exerted by
the Administration. Sir John Griffin<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a> the day before
had mentioned too the case of A’Court, and said he
himself would not be intimidated by the disgrace of
ten more generals. The Court at last yielded the
point; and the 26th was fixed for hearing the complaint.</p>

<p>Sir William Meredith<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> and Sir George Saville were
both men of character, and both singular in different
ways. The first was a convert from Jacobitism; inflexibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
serious, and of no clear head: yet practice
formed him to a manner of speaking that had weight,
and was worth attending to by those who had patience
for it. He was, I believe, an honest man, though not
without personal views, which a little sharpened his
scorn of those who had unlike views, and were not
equally honest.</p>

<p>Sir George Saville had a head as acutely argumentative
as if it had been made by a German logician
for a model. Could ministers have been found acting
by the advice of casuists and confessors, Sir George
would still have started distinctions to hamper their
consciences; but though they walked not in such ruled
paths, his want of ambition carried him so seldom to
the House, that they were not often troubled with his
subtleties. He had a large fortune, and a larger mind;
and though his reason was sharp, his soul was candid,
having none of the acrimony or vengeance of party:
thence was he of greater credit than service to that in
which he listed.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
On the 23rd these two Baronets moved to put off
the affair of Wilkes’s complaint of breach of privilege
to the 13th of February, as the material evidence,
Wilkes’s servant, was in France with him. Sir
George particularly attacked Grenville with much
spirit. Grenville, as usual, spoke too long, though not
ill, insinuating that this delay was calculated to keep
up the flame. “He had always,” he said, “been averse
to having this matter discussed, which had better never
be decided; and that he had only given way in order
to vindicate Lord Halifax and Lord Egremont.” It
was perhaps true, that in some cases it were better that
certain powers should not be defined. It might be of
use that traitors should think Ministers have power of
committing by General Warrants even members of
Parliament; and at the same time Ministers ought not
to have that power absolutely bestowed on them. But
when once the case has happened, and that dormant
or supposed power has been abused, it must be inquired
into and regulated; or acquiescence constitutes
the second evil hinted at above. But in any case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
Grenville’s argument was faulty, for if it was desirable
for the public that the case should not be defined, the
private vindication of two men ought not to supersede
that utility. However, though the minority on putting
the question were not loud for it, the ministry gave
it up. Sir George Saville took occasion to make it
observed, that so bad was his opinion of Wilkes, he
had taken no part till, the man being expelled, nothing
but the cause of the House in point of privilege
seemed to remain. This did honour to Sir George,
but prejudiced Wilkes and the cause of liberty. The
former’s character, as I have said, was very fair: and
indeed most of the Opposition were unexceptionable
in that light. Yet Wilkes had, early in his warfare
on the Court, told Rigby that he liked the ministers
better than their opponents (no great compliment to
the first), and desired him to apply to Fox to make
him (Wilkes) governor of Canada—a proposal Fox
rejected. It was not to be wondered at that Wilkes,
so libertine and jovial, should not be captivated with
the company of a set of young men who were as free
from the spirit and vivacity as from the vices of their
age. The chiefs were of eminent rank, and besides
losing the power they thought affected to their birth,
had been wantonly insulted by the Court. But wanting
parts to preserve their power, they equally wanted
them to recover it. Yet was the Court itself alarmed
at a club into which the Opposition formed themselves,
holding their weekly meetings at a tavern erected on
the occasion by one Wildman, in Albemarle Street<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>—a
circumstance I mention rather as an antiquary than
historian; several pamphlets being published at this
time addressed to, or written in the name of, that
society.</p>

<p>On the 24th, Dowdeswell proposed a Committee of
the whole House, to consider the Cider Bill. Grenville
opposed that motion, agreeing only to have a Committee
to examine the grievances occasioned by it,
and to suggest corrections, but not with power to repeal
the bill. These restrictions were carried by 167
to 125.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<p>The same day the House of Lords sat on the <cite>Essay
on Woman</cite>. Lord Sandwich moved to vote Wilkes
the author of it, and to order him to be taken into
custody. The Duke of Devonshire, and even the
Duke of Richmond, though a courtier, spoke against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
this summary proceeding; and warm words passed
between Lord Temple and Lord Marchmont, the
latter of whom said, that though Wilkes was gone,
he had left his gang behind him. At last both questions
were formed into this one,—that it appearing to
the House that Wilkes was the author, he should be
taken into custody: but as he had withdrawn himself,
a Committee was appointed to search for precedents
how to proceed.</p>

<p>On the 25th, Sir John Glynn in a very thin House
moved to re-consider the Marriage Act; and a Committee
was appointed. Sir John Philipps, too, proposed
to re-appoint the Committee of the last year for
inspecting the public accounts, and it was carried by
90 to 30 odd. Lord Holland and the Duke of Newcastle
had concurred to bring that inquiry to nothing,
contriving to have the time wasted on the accounts of
the ordnance.</p>

<p>On the 31st Dowdeswell moved a question against
excise, though without naming it, in the Committee
on the Cider Bill, but it was thrown out by 172 to
152, seven of the minority being shut out when the
question was putting: so near was the Court run by
the minority, though without leaders, and frequently
obstructed and distressed by the fluctuation of the
family of Yorke, and the duplicity of Charles Townshend,
who oftener spoke against than for them, and
<em>that</em> generally when he had given the most solemn
assurances of his support.</p>

<p>On Feb. 3rd, late in the day, Sir William Meredith
moved for the evidence on which the Secretaries
of State had granted the warrant against Wilkes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
The Ministry complained of the lateness of the hour,
and Rigby moved to adjourn. Charles Townshend
attacked Grenville on it, and was even seconded by
his brother, the General; but the adjournment was
carried by 73 to 60.</p>

<p>On the 6th there was a good debate<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> on Wilkes’s
complaint of breach of privilege, when Sir W. Meredith
and Sir George Saville defended themselves
against the imputation of want of candour, in having
made their motion late in a thin House; the former
proving that many violent questions had been proposed
seven hours later than theirs had been. He
moved for the warrant on which Wilkes had been
apprehended, and for the information on which it
had been grounded. To avoid the demand, Sir John
Philipps moved the previous question, declaring that
he meant to discharge the complaint. Lord Strange
was at first for having the warrant produced; but
soon retracted, and said the complaint ought to be
discharged, as the suit was depending at common law—an
argument that had been pressed on the Ministers
when Wilkes’s expulsion was agitated, and which they
then had refused to admit.</p>

<p>I have more than once, in the former part of these
Memoirs, touched on the character of Lord Strange,
as a man acting on notions of his own, unwedded
to any faction, and above temptations of money.
He had, however, been gained by Fox to the Court,
in the present reign, by the offer of the post of Chancellor
of the Duchy of Lancaster, the county where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
his estate and interest lay. The large number of
places in the disposal of that officer, could gratify his
passion for sway in his own province; so true was the
maxim of Sir Robert Walpole, that <em>every man has his
price</em>; and so judiciously was this office held out to
Lord Strange; for though he accepted the post on
the views I have mentioned, he nobly refused to take
the annexed salary of 1200<i>l.</i> a year. He seldom afterwards
differed with the successive administrations, but
rarely attended Parliament.</p>

<p>Sir William Meredith consented to waive his demand
of the information, though Beckford protested
that he himself had never, as a justice of peace, granted
a warrant without information on oath. Norton
pleaded, that to grant it would instruct the accuser,
Wilkes, in the defence of the accused Secretaries and
Under-Secretaries of State; but T. Townshend urged
that it had already appeared in the Court of Common
Pleas, and in the ordinary newspapers. George Grenville<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a>
said that producing the warrant would engage
the House to pronounce on the legality or illegality
of it. Would the House declare that any papers
might be seized? Would it declare that none might?
Sir Anthony Abdy,<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> a lawyer attached to the Duke
of Devonshire, said, a sight of the warrant was demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
as much for the excuse of such members of
the House as had been concerned in it, as for blame;
and General Conway added, that if the information
was the defence of Wood and the others, how would
it hurt them? But, said he, this matter is treated as
too high for our inspection. I thought I lived in a
free country. We have already chosen to give up
our own privilege, and now are afraid to inquire on
what grounds it is taken from us.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> Nugent, Morton,
Elliot, Wilbraham, Dr. Hay, Wood himself, Lord
Frederick Campbell, Forester, Oswald,<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> Ellis, Lord
North, and Sir John Glynn, debated the question for
the Court, besides those I have mentioned; on the
other side, Hewet,<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a> King’s Sergeant, Mawbey, Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
George Sackville, Dowdeswell, Fitzherbert, Dempster,
Charles Townshend, and Onslow; but the previous
question was carried by 217 to 122.</p>

<p>The next day the Cider Bill was compromised, and
two shillings imposed instead of five.</p>

<p>On the 9th, the day appointed for considering the
Marriage Bill, Charles Yorke opposed going into Committee,
and said Sir John Glynn should have stated
objections, and proposed amendments; wished to have
a bill brought in for that purpose. He talked of the
wisdom and temper with which it had been carried
through before: the truth of which may be seen in
my former account of that bill. Rigby was for going
into the Committee, his patron the Duke of Bedford
having been, and continuing to be, its warm adversary.
Lord Strange ridiculed ecclesiastical law, and frankly
spoke of marriage as only legal cohabitation. George
Grenville stayed away, and Lord Holland’s friends were
for repealing the bill. The Opposition, to court the
Yorkes, were against altering it; but it was carried
by 157 to 79, for a Committee to re-examine it. It
was then proposed to go into the Committee on that
day sevennight: Charles Yorke and General Townshend
for the Monday sevennight after. Charles
Townshend, who had shone so brightly against the
original bill, kept away; but it was carried for the
Wednesday, by 70 to 39.</p>

<p>On the 13th, the House of Commons entered seriously
on the great question of breach of privilege
on Wilkes’s complaint, and the first day sat till midnight,
four hundred and fifty members being present.
Sir William Meredith opened the debate with calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
for the three messengers who had executed the warrant,
and for Matthew Brown, Wilkes’s servant, who
gave an account of what had passed when his master
was seized. I shall not recapitulate these examinations,
which may be found in the journals of the
House; nor what was said by other witnesses. Their
depositions lasted till nine at night. Philip Carteret
Webbe then made his defence; and it was so scurvy,
that he was reduced to plead inadvertence, and his
being a servant of the Secretary of State. He even
had the front to affirm, that there had been no intention
of making Wilkes <em>close</em> prisoner. He then offered
to produce his evidence, but, it being late, G. Grenville
asked if they would proceed or not? Mr. Pitt said
he thought they ought not to stop till they knew
whether they still had a Constitution or not? Lord
Frederick Campbell, supported by Rose Fuller and
General Townshend, moved to adjourn. Thomas
Townshend the younger urged that the House had
voted the expulsion of a member at four o’clock in
the morning—would not they proceed to hear his
complaint at eleven at night? Mr. Pitt said it was
derogatory from the honour of the House to adjourn.
His own first wish had been to crush foreign enemies;
now it was to crush domestic. When that was done
he should die willingly. The question was then put,
but the Ministers not caring to hazard their majority,
when the House seemed inclined to proceed, few of
their party went out in the division; and thence it was
carried by 379 to 31, to go on.</p>

<p>The record of the writ of Habeas Corpus, and the
returns to it, were then read; but so many of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
members had retired after the division, to eating-houses
and coffee-houses to refresh themselves, that
the Ministers objected that evidence was not fairly
heard on their side; and Sir James Lowther moving
to adjourn, it was carried without a division a quarter
before twelve.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in hearing precedents of
general warrants, in which there appeared but too much
countenance for the practice, yet founded on no law.
The greater part had been issued against Jacobites, on
the accession of the present Royal Family, when their
establishment was new, and precarious. The Lord Viscount
Townshend,<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> a zealous, bold, and authoritative
Minister, had made free with the practice. It had
been used even in cases of libels, but always in those
of Jacobite tendency. Many in times of rebellion had
been issued by the Duke of Newcastle, and three by
Mr. Pitt himself, but against persons suspected of
treasonable practices. These documents had Carteret
Webbe now collected: he printed them, too, in his
justification. But the case of Wilkes was not only
dissimilar, but was important enough to call for redress
of a power so obnoxious and liable to abuse. At one
in the morning Sir William Meredith commenced the
debate, and to what I have said added the history of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
those warrants. Fifty persons, he owned, had been
taken up on such warrants; and then Wilkes on a
like indefinite warrant. His very pocket-book had
been seized to find evidence against him. The gentlemen
who apprehended him were mere ministerial
officers. The first warrant quoted was of 1662, for
then was passed the first act for licensing the press:
and as that act was temporary, and has not been
revived, it is a proof that there is no law since to
authorize such restraint. The warrants themselves
have been found by the Court of Common Pleas
to be illegal. He then read the two resolutions he
proposed to move; the first, that <em>a general warrant
for seizing authors and papers is not law</em>. The second,
that <em>seizing Members of Parliament by general warrant
is contrary to privilege</em>. Breach of privilege, he added,
might be committed <em>in the manner</em>, even where there
is no privilege. These warrants had never been used
but in times of danger, and then were followed by
Acts of Indemnity, and thence never came to be questioned.
They were suspended from 1675 to 1690,
and then were resumed to protect the Revolution.
Again in 1715 and 1745, the years of the Scottish
rebellions. They were now used for such a trifle as
a libel, that was in every man’s hand. The licentiousness
of the people had been checked: it was time now
to quiet their minds by checking the licentiousness of
power.</p>

<p>Lord Frederick Campbell, with much warmth, called
on the House to vindicate Wood and Webbe, their
accused members. Wood said he had done his duty,
and hoped to be restored to the precise situation in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
which he had stood before the accusation. Sir W. Meredith
said, Lord Chief Justice Keeling being accused,
pleaded he had acted by precedent. The practice was
censured before the person, as it is necessary to ascertain
the crime ere the criminal can be condemned.
Charles Yorke said he hoped to hear Keeling’s case
read another day; and then moved to adjourn. Norton
said he was willing to have the general case adjourned,
but not the particular one of the accused. The debate
took that turn of postponing the case of the warrants,
but the Ministers insisted on disculpating the accused,
Grenville particularly declaring for discharging the
complaint of breach of privilege. Pitt replied, that
if the second question should pass, it would be impossible
entirely to acquit the accused. They could not
be acquitted or condemned till the general question
should be affirmed or condemned. If the warrant
should be declared illegal, he would extenuate their
behaviour as having acted by precedent. To this
Wood, with much heat and arrogance replied, that he
would not accept of being <em>excused</em>.</p>

<p>Wood,<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> originally a travelling tutor and excellent
classic scholar, is well known from those beautiful and
simple Essays prefixed to the editions of the <cite>Ruins of
Balbec and Palmyra</cite>;<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> whither he had travelled with
two<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> young gentlemen of fortune and curiosity. His
taste and ingenuity had recommended him to Mr. Pitt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
for his private secretary when Minister; but the observance
required by Pitt, and the pride, though dormant,
of Wood, had been far from cementing their
connection. Wood had then attached himself to the
Duke of Bridgwater, and through him to the Bedford
faction; but remaining in office when Mr. Pitt quitted,
had, with too much readiness, complied with the
orders of his new masters. His general behaviour was
decent, as became his dependent situation; but his
nature was hot, and veering to despotic.</p>

<p>Lord George Sackville told him that intentionally
he had done right, but was not ready to say that he
had done legally right. Lord Strange said he would
not consent to postpone the acquittal of the accused.
General Townshend desired to have the debate adjourned
to Friday 17th, being obliged to give attendance
on his father, who was dying. His brother
Charles, more decently than the rest, said the questions
were the same, and required the same discussion: he
would not consent to divide them. In truth, there
could be no thought of separating them but in compliment
to Wood, for few could have any partiality
for Webbe. Sir William Meredith and Sir George
Saville, both candid men, had wished to avoid naming
persons,—a respect detrimental in great national questions;
for not only the multitude will more easily be
led by names than by speculation and theory, but what
Ministers will fear to offend, if censure only touches
their practice, not their persons? It is to the honour
of the persons who composed that Opposition that their
delicacy frequently, nay, constantly, hurt their cause.
Yet should that delicacy not be imitated. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
freedom of a nation is at stake, what chance has
liberty, if opponents have scruples for Ministers who
have none?</p>

<p>Charles Yorke and Dowdeswell then moved to adjourn
till Friday; and General Conway observed justly,
that if the accused were acquitted first, the general
question would not be left entire; for could the House
vote that general warrants were illegal, after it should
have voted that they who executed those warrants
were blameless? Yet Wood continued loudly to demand
his justification. Mr. Pitt was for adjourning
the whole debate; and said, if this was not agreed to,
he would debate the whole. Sir George Saville said,
Wood was guilty of impatience, though an honest
one; and complained that he and Sir William Meredith
were not suffered to prove their whole charge.</p>

<p>At half an hour after four in the morning the House
divided, the Opposition being for adjourning the whole
matter; and to the great dismay of the courtiers, the
Ministerial party were but 207, and the opponents
197—a triumph in parliamentary cases little preferable
to a defeat; so strong had been the alarm on seizing
the papers, and so evident was it that the Ministerial
majority had been the work of venality against conviction.</p>

<p>Dr. Hay then moved to discharge the complaint;
but Pitt, roused by this swell of his party, and feeling
the weight of so large a minority, poured forth one of
his finest rhapsodies on liberty, though at that late
hour, and after the fatigue of so long an attendance
and attention: and he severely reprimanded Wood’s
insolence, telling him that, if he would not accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
excuse, he deserved censure. Grenville asked why
these persons were blamed, and not all their predecessors?<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a>
Pitt, still rising in fire and importance, took
the whole debate on himself, asking what he had done,
but in a war which he was called upon to invigorate?
He had never turned out officers; he had sought for
merit in those who <em>now</em> held precarious commissions,
not by military service. They had not only saved
their country, but him who had been undone if they
had not saved their country.</p>

<p>Grenville, not losing courage on this turn of fortune,
replied ably and finely. He knew, he said,
the nation was left on the brink of ruin.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> The Ministers
had had enough to do without hunting in alleys
for libels. He then painted faction, first setting England
against Scotland; then reviving party names, and
drawing the line between the Parliament and people.
Look! said he, look at Wilkes’s letters, where he
talks of <em>rare combustibles</em>!</p>

<p><em>Colonel</em><a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> Barré, rising to speak, and being pointed
to by the Speaker under that military appellation,
thanked him, but said he had no right to that title;
yet it gave him occasion to ask why he had been
dismissed? what had his Majesty done on his accession?
He looked out if any man had been whispered
out of the service, and did him ample justice. (This
alluded to Sir Henry Erskine, dismissed in the late
reign, and restored to his rank by the present King;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
a speaking instance against the change of measures
since adopted.) Himself, he said, was of no consequence,
but let Ministers take care how they deprived
the Crown of other faithful servants at the end of
a glorious war. Non de vectigalibus agitur, sed de
animâ nostra res agitur. Precedents did not justify:
Charles the First had acted on precedents.</p>

<p>Onslow congratulated Grenville ironically on having
never given one vote for the last ruinous war, which
he now so much condemned. And they, said he, who
are for acquitting these gentlemen, ought to remember
who insisted on having their two names inserted,
when Sir George Saville and Sir W. Meredith would
have omitted them. In fact, the Ministers had got
the names inserted with the view of having them
cleared by a vote of the House.</p>

<p>Mawbey then moved to adjourn, which was overruled
by 208 to 184, and then the complaint being
discharged, the House rose at half an hour after seven
in the morning, the longest sitting on record, exceeding
that on the Westminster Election, in 1742, and
the last sitting on the Militia Bill, in 17—; but this
latter was less a debate than the perseverance of a
very few persons who sat till six in the morning to
perfect that bill.</p>

<p>The Court was strangely alarmed at this sudden rise
of the Opposition, and set them roundly to oppose
its progress, well knowing that when once the scale
turns, it is difficult to secure even the venal, who hurry
over to the side to which fortune seems inclining.
Nor was much time given them to rally their forces,
the great question coming on within four days.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang b2">Debates on the legality of General Warrants, and the conduct of
Wilkes, continued.—Treatise entitled “Droit le Roi,” condemned
by the Lords.—Wilkes found guilty of being the Author of “The
North Briton” and the “Essay on Woman.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Feb. 17th the House went into the debate on the
subject, <em>that a general warrant for seizing the author,
printer, &amp;c., of a seditious libel, is not legal</em>. Dr. Hay
said it was evident this had been the practice, nor
had the Courts below condemned it. He should,
therefore, propose an amendment, that the question
might be stated clearly and precisely. If that correction
was agreed to, he intended to offer others that
should condemn the whole practice of the secretary’s
office. He then moved to add the word <em>treasonable</em>
after <em>seditious</em>; and then he would propose, he said,
to subjoin the following sentence, <em>though such warrant
hath been according to the practice of office, and has not
been condemned by any courts of justice in which such
warrants have been produced</em>. He was seconded by
Wedderburne, who argued against taking up one particular
warrant, half excusing that in question by
saying, he would not affirm that practice makes
law. Pitt ridiculed the Doctor and the Ministry for
trying to perplex the question; but owning handsomely
that he should like the question better if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
spread over the whole practice, and not confined to
the single instance before them. If his own practice
had been faulty, he was willing to bear his share of
public blame. He called on the Ministers to show
what was really the subject matter of the question:
was it on <em>seditious</em> libels? then do not cut and shuffle
with our liberties by an epithet. We had seen the
day when an epithet would defeat Magna Charta.
Any other epithet of four syllables would throw dust
in the eyes of members, as well as <em>treasonable</em>. But
now, said he, they parry and <em>twist</em>, and I like it the
better. I am glad that all the learned doctor’s abilities
could produce was an epithet. But keep separate
things separate in their nature. Vote the general
question on <em>seditions</em> first. We never desire to alter
the practice in cases of high treason. The learned
gentleman, he supposed, would allow that there might
be seditious libels without treason in them. It was
shallow, the artifice of attempting to draw in gentlemen
to condemn seditious warrants by coupling the
word <em>treasonable</em> to them, which aggravates the offence;
but by not daring to let the question stand
simply on its own merits, on the case of a general
warrant issued against a seditious libel, not a treasonable
one, they tacitly avowed that the libel not being
treasonable, their own conduct had been illegal. But
no general warrant to search universally without specification
of name or place, was allowable, even in
case of treason. <em>General warrants are always wrong</em>;
yet if this amendment left the House at liberty to
debate on the whole question, and not on that amendment
solely, he would not be against the stating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
those words. Hay was hurt, and said he had nowhere
been accustomed to the manœuvre of quibbles:
he had only affirmed that general warrants had been
produced in other courts: he had not said that those
courts had decided on them. Conway pursued Pitt’s
argument, and showed how totally the original question
and the proposed alteration of it differed; that
if anything could authorize a general warrant, it was
treason. By inserting that word, the Ministers betrayed
the badness of their own cause; he feared
they were a little tender; that they could not bear
the last division. He honoured the lights of the
law, but feared the House had a little too much of
them: yet could those learned men prove that treason
and sedition were the same? Why was it necessary,
too, to describe historically what had been the custom?
The case was clear and simple, when a gentleman
came and slipped in a word that totally varied the
argument: it was <em>white</em>, he inserts the word <em>black</em>;
and thus would vote that the Ministers had not done
wrong by taking up a man for a crime of which he
had not been guilty. If a general warrant is good
against treason, and not against sedition, and yet you
couple them, and make them one crime, are Ministers
blameless for inflicting on sedition the punishment
only due to treason? Separate the questions, and
vote, if you can, that the warrant was legal.</p>

<p>Hussey<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> said he liked the amendment, because he
disliked all general warrants; for what was to follow,
he did not understand it. Did it mean to imply that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
the silence of the King’s Bench was affirmation?
He feared some such thing was meant; but it would
be a libel on the Judges that sit there. He did not,
however, he said, mean to extend his argument to
high treason. He wished to have general warrants
condemned, because to some there stood the names
of men of virtue, which seemed to authorize so bad a
practice. Wedderburne said sharply, that he had
guarded himself by alleging that the practice of the
King’s Bench could not make law: but they had
been taunted with epithets; the time was come when
men would no longer be led by epithets<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> and flowery
declamation. It was hurting our country to study
popularity by vilifying the profession of the law.
Was a definition nothing but epithets? The Opposition,
he knew, would be glad, if they could, to stand
clear of epithets. Charles Yorke was for adopting
the amendments, and spoke for temper. <em>Treasonable</em>
corresponded with the evidence given at the bar. The
common warrants had that description in them. He
was for stating what had been the common usage,
and then for condemning it. None of those warrants
had come before the Courts below for argument or
consideration. Sir William Meredith said, he hoped
this point would be decided by the spirit of liberty,
not by law; and with some heat added, “I never
passed my life with the vices of Wilkes.” This sentence,
provoked by what had fallen from Wedderburne,
and supposed to be aimed, as it justly might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
have been, at Dr. Hay, who, though so servile now,
had been the intimate of Wilkes,<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> was levelled at
Lord Sandwich. But Wedderburne took it up, and
said, if Sir William had meant anything unparliamentary,
he might have taken another place. Dr.
Hay, thinking it necessary to vindicate himself, did
not conciliate more favour. He had long, he said,
known the unhappy man, had received pleasure and
instruction from him, but with many good qualities
he had grown profligate; did not know who incited
him; had advised him against his excesses; “Yet,” said
he, “I am no hypocrite; I have told him he was grown
the <em>God</em> of defamation from keeping seditious company;
he had even attacked the Crown, and the <em>parent</em>
of the Crown; for himself, he pitied the poor <em>devil</em>.”
Some persons interposing to prevent a duel, Sir W.
Meredith said, he had every day been aspersed as
taking up this matter for the sake of Wilkes. This
he could not bear. Wedderburne had taken it up
on tip-toe, though neither pointed at him nor Dr.
Hay. Himself would last year have stopped Wilkes’s
behaviour.</p>

<p>Hussey then proposed to insert the words <em>in the
King’s Bench, where the warrants had never been condemned
or approved, whereas they had been condemned in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
the Court of Common Pleas</em>. To this Norton agreed,
though he said he would show that they had been
approved in the King’s Bench. Prisoners are brought
thither by Habeas Corpus, and the court is counsel for
the prisoner. They examine the legality of the commitment,
and must remit him, or bail him, or remand
him. Remanding him, or requiring bail, is approving
the commitment. Pitt proposed to add, “in which
court (the King’s Bench) it does not appear that the
validity of general warrants has been brought in question.”
Charles Yorke said he agreed with Pitt, but
would have the sentence run thus, “although hath
been frequently produced to, and never been questioned
by, the King’s Bench.” Sir William said he
could not agree to the amendment, for the House had
only heard evidence ex-parte for exculpation of the
accused Ministers. Pitt objecting strongly to the
words <em>never questioned</em>, Charles Yorke offered these,
“and the validity never debated.” Forester approved
this, and asked if the point had never been litigated,
why should those words be inserted? George Grenville
protested that nothing should make him say that
<em>all</em> those warrants were legal; but with Norton he desired
to add, “though the parties have been remanded
and bailed.” Pitt, offended that the opinion of some
Judges had been quoted in defence of the warrant,
said, he was no judge, but sat there to judge Judges.
There had not been a violation of the Constitution but
had been sanctified by the greatest Judges. Let Norton
turn to evidence and prove such prisoners had
been remanded. If discharged, let the House have
that evidence also. Conway treated the whole amendment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
as trifling; and asked if they would take no
notice of the decision of the Common Pleas against
the legality of the warrant, and yet would take notice
of a <em>no</em> decision? He wished to have the whole
referred to a Committee. Charles Yorke affirmed that
none had been remanded; but agreed with Norton
that they had been bailed. Charles Townshend
asked, since the lawyers allowed that bail might be
given on an erroneous warrant, why they would <em>mention
it</em>? Norton owned that he meant from thence
to argue for the legality. The amendments were
agreed to.</p>

<p>The Court having carried this point, Norton impudently
confessed this was what he had aimed at; and
as there were so many causes connected with this depending
in the Courts below, he should move to put
off the question for four months. The Ministers did
not doubt but the legality of the warrants would be
condemned in Westminster Hall; yet a previous censure
in Parliament might not only ensure that decision,
but produce arraignment of the Administration.
They feared, from what had passed in the foregoing
day, that they should never be able to carry an approbation
of the warrants,—and if they could, into what
confusion must the nation have fallen, if such warrants
were upheld by Parliament, and anathematized
in the other courts? Their plan, therefore, was to
jockey: and the Opposition had fallen into the snare.
It had been proposed that Lord Granby should
move the adjournment; he refused, and yet spoke
for it,—and was immediately rewarded with the
Lieutenancy of Derbyshire, which the Duke of Devonshire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
had resigned, and wished, from the rivalship
between their families in that county, to see in any
other hands.</p>

<p>Norton, continuing to triumph in the arts of attorneyship,
asked to what end the House should decide
on the point which was to be determined elsewhere?
Let, he said, a Committee be appointed to draw up
a bill. The practice of a court does make law. For
Secretaries of State he demanded more power than
for a common justice of peace. The House sits to
make laws, not to expound them. He then dropped
this sentence, so decent, yet so worthy of the mouth
it fell from, and so often flung in his teeth,—<em>If I was
a Judge, I should pay no more regard to this resolution
than to that of a drunken porter</em>;—a sentence that
would have made old Onslow<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> thunder forth indignation!
Norton then moved to adjourn the debate
for four months, as so many causes were depending on
the illegality.</p>

<p>Charles Yorke made a very long speech against
postponing a present decision, as against the dignity of
the House: and he scrupled not to pronounce the
warrant illegal, which he protested he had never seen
till Wilkes was taken up; nor had any question been
asked of the Attorney or Solicitor Generals by the
Administration. Warrants dated from the Star Chamber.
Himself had always been for taking this matter
up in Parliament, notwithstanding its pendency below.
Previous questions, to avoid debates, may be useful
during foreign treaties, but never in cases of privilege.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
In questions of this sort the House ought to hold the
balance between King and people. It was a question
in point of law impossible to be denied. Were he
a Judge, he should pay regard to the decision of the
House of Commons. The question ought to be determined
for the sake of the Secretaries of State. He
must be for some law.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Yorke disculpated himself of not
having seen the warrant, yet the Ministers protested
that after Wilkes was taken up, Yorke had given his
opinion that No. 45 was a libel, and had advised the
commitment of him to the Tower. This was advising
a man to knock down another, and then pleading that
he had not seen the bludgeon. Lord North said, if
a law was necessary, a partial resolution was trifling.
By deferring this, they meant to introduce something
much better.</p>

<p>Lord George Sackville said, it would only alarm the
nation, to fling over the question the thin parliamentary
veil of adjournment. When could a question of
liberty be so properly taken up as under such a King?
It was the time to lop such an excrescence. Lord
North had promised much, but would perform nothing.
The House of Commons singly cannot make law; but
can declare upon it. He thanked God that on this
question the whole body of lawyers was not on the
side of power: that battery would be too much to
stand. How came the Secretaries of State by this
practice, but from the Star Chamber and Licensing
Act? It had never been abused till now, for it had
been exercised only against traitors. A discretionary
power must always be at the peril of the Secretary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
that uses it. But he would therefore declare it illegal
for a warning to them, and to show the people that
they had a watchful House of Commons.</p>

<p>Nugent said, “Liberty rings round the House, and
we may all be unanimously in the wrong.” “We are
not likely to be <em>unanimously</em> wrong,” replied Conway,
“nor rash, for nothing was ever so fully debated. The
Ministers had narrowed the question to Wilkes, and
then called it too narrow. The previous question
would in effect be a negative. Wood had called for
immediate decision. There had been issued but one
warrant as extensive as this down to the time of Lord
Townshend, and that had been in the reign of Charles
the Second. He that gives a power of tyranny gives
tyranny.” Hussey added, that the Licensing Act had
been dropped because the Peers would not consent
to let their houses be searched.</p>

<p>Lord Frederick Campbell said that in a fortnight’s
time general warrants would be determined to be illegal;
and then, what Secretary of State would dare to
sign one? Lord Granby, declaring he thought them
illegal because Lord Chief Justice Pratt had thought
so, said, no Secretary of State after that opinion would
venture to issue them.</p>

<p>Charles Townshend made a most capital speech,
replete with argument, history, and law, though severe
on the lawyers: a speech, like most of his, easier to be
described than detailed. How great, he said, must be
the talents of Norton, if the House heard him with
patience, though comparing them to a <em>drunken porter</em>.
Whether in the House or out of the House, Norton,
he feared, would be fatal to the cause. He then gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
the history of the Licensing Act, and read the resolution
of the year 1675, drawn by Mr. Locke, and the
report of Lord Chief Justice Vaughan of usage not
constituting law. Had Norton lived in the age of
ship-money, how he would have argued for putting off
the decision of its being illegal! But it was become
more necessary to alter this, because of the many precedents
in its favour. He then gave a description of
the warrant against Wilkes, and how long they had
been before they applied it to him. He abhorred
Wilkes, he said; and drew a severe picture of him,
and another panegyrical of the great Whig Lords at the
time of the Revolution, and of those at the accession of
the present Royal Family. “But it seems,” continued
he, “we are not to have a resolution, but a bill. The
first time was always the best time; the natural mode
the best mode. One advantage had been derived from
Wilkes, he had stopped a growing evil. Nobody
could think what thirty years more in abler hands
would have done. This warrant without description
of person might take up any man under any description
of a libel. If the House did not come to some
resolution, what dissatisfaction it must create. Mankind
would learn that the lawyers were divided in
their sentiments on the legality, and would be clamorous
to have settled a point so important to the
security of their persons, houses, and papers. But do
not be wheedled by promises; who gives promises
gives deceit.” He praised Mr. Pitt, and concluded
with saying that this warrant was like an experiment
in anatomy, which might be tried on a poor man.
Wilkes is odious, cry the Ministers; commit him. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
Parliament suffers it, you may strike at higher
objects.</p>

<p>After several other speeches, Pitt said “this was not
a warrant, but a delegation of magistracy, which the
Crown could not give, and should Secretaries of State
give it? The debate had been carried on without
heat—indeed with too much coldness. Lawyers
termed this warrant erroneous;—was that term harsh
enough? Hear the language of Ministers and their
agents: Carteret Webbe said he had settled Wilkes
<em>comfortably</em> in the Tower with his shaving things!
Then, they say, you need not pronounce this illegal;
Secretaries of State will be sufficiently frightened;
the Judges may or may not declare it illegal; and you
shall have a law. I should be against such a law; it
would be augmenting the power of the Crown by law.
What will our constituents say if we do not ascertain
their liberties? How do you know the Lords will
agree to the bill? Not doing is doing.”</p>

<p>He was answered by Grenville and Sir John Philipps;
but Lord Howe,<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> though a Lord of the Admiralty,
spoke against the adjournment. Elliot said, if
there must be a victim, they might have a hecatomb
of Ministers who had signed such warrants. These
warrants, it seemed, had stalked about unknown to
Mr. Pitt, who had been Secretary of State, and to
Mr. Yorke, Attorney-General.</p>

<p>Colonel Barré ridiculed Lord Barrington, Elliot, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
Grenville, with much humour. “Lord Granby thinks,”
added he, “that no Secretary of State will venture on
these warrants after Pratt’s opinion; but Grenville says
that opinion was <em>undue</em>, erroneous, and precipitate.”
For himself, he esteemed the professors of the law, but
detested the profession. Pratt he commended; and
said, “shall France deride our languor when her Parliaments
are making such strides towards liberty?”</p>

<p>At five in the morning the House divided, and
the adjournment was carried by 232 against 218;
a majority of only fourteen. The world expected
that the Ministers would resign—at least endeavour
to treat.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a></p>

<p>The offensive behaviour of Norton in the preceding
debate, brought out a story very characteristic of his
unfeeling nature. When Dr. Hensey was condemned
for treason in the last reign, Lord Mansfield asked
Pratt, the Attorney-General, when he would have him
executed? Pratt, struck with compassion, could not
bring himself to fix the day. Lord Mansfield then
asked Norton, who, turning to the prisoner, said, “Doctor,
when will it be agreeable to you to be executed?”<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></p>

<p>While mankind expected that the Opposition would
vigorously pursue the advantage of so large an increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
of their numbers, day after day, and week after
week slipped away without their exerting one symptom
of spirit or activity. No motions were made, no
inquiries set on foot, no zeal expressed to keep up the
passions and hopes of the party. Without doors all
hearts were with them, and ready to second their
attempts with clamour and applause. At first they
seemed to expect that the Ministers would come and
lay their places at their feet. The dream itself was
over before an effort was made to realise it. Not a
pamphlet was written, not a meeting was held, to concert
farther measures. A supineness unparalleled!
but to be accounted for from the composition of that
minority. Pitt affected to be courted to discountenance
party, and to be placed at the head of everything
without seeming to desire it. He despised
Newcastle, and resented the manner in which he had
been treated by that Duke, by Devonshire, by Hardwicke,
and the Yorkes. Charles Yorke was, besides,
incompatible with Pitt’s friend, the Chief Justice
Pratt, as the Chancellor’s seal was equally the object
of both. Lord Temple, the soul of faction, was detested
by the whole party, except by his own small
connection. Charles Townshend was attached to nobody,
and trusted by nobody. Legge was industrious,
but not spirited: he could negotiate for himself, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
not for a party. Conway had singly meant to arraign
the warrants, and had no thought of dipping in faction.
Some were too fair, and others too dirty, to take the
general steps that might lead to the good of the whole
party: and thus, where there was no concert, and in
truth but few able men, there could be no consequences
but inactivity and defeat. That defeat fell
heavy on the most conscientious, who having offended
the Court by their opposition, were thus exposed a
sacrifice to its resentments.</p>

<p>Nor was this conduct, I doubt, solely founded on
inability and outward disunion. Pitt might expect to
be again sent for by Lord Bute, and was unwilling
to be clogged with numerous dependents, odious to
the Favourite, and distasteful to himself. He and Lord
Temple had far more rancour against their brother,
George Grenville, than against Lord Bute; and Pitt,
at least, had never been personal against the Favourite,
who, with all his resentment to Lord Temple, as the
instigator of Wilkes, had received more recent stabs
from George Grenville. Whether during this suspension
of hostilities, any negotiation was renewed, I do
not pretend to say; nor is it important, as it certainly
had no effect, unless that material one of cooling the
growing party.</p>

<p>The Ministers, on the other hand, wore a good countenance,
and were as alert as their adversaries were
supine and lifeless. To procure votes, to work underground,
to write letters, dispatch messengers, and collect
all possible forces, this was the fort and excellence
of Sandwich’s genius. He and Rigby were desperate,
and Grenville little less so. They soon perceived the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
want of discipline in the enemy’s troops, and the insufficiency
of their commanders. With some address
of their own, and with the defect of it in their
opponents, they weathered the session, obtained full
power, and showed that they dared to make use of
it despotically.</p>

<p>On the very day of the last great debate in the
House of Commons, Lord Lyttelton, seconded by the
Duke of Grafton, acquainted the Lords that on the
following Tuesday he should lay a complaint before
them against a new book called <cite>Droit le Roi</cite>. This
pestilent treatise was a collection from old statutes
and obsolete customs of the darkest and most arbitrary
ages of whatever tended, or had tended, to show and
uphold the prerogative of the Crown. The fulsome
flattery and servility of ancient lawyers in every reign
were amassed together, and shoved upon the world as
the standing law of England; no retrospect had to all
the immunities obtained since by the Civil War, by
the Revolution, and by various other struggles of Parliaments
with the Crown. Such a code obtruded on
the Crown, as a codicil to the stretch of General
Warrants, spoke for itself. It was incense laid on an
altar erected to power on which human sacrifices had
already been offered. Without metaphor, such a compilation
proved that prerogative must have been the
object of the Court before such gross adulation could
dare to step forth in the face of both Houses of
Parliament. The author was one Brecknock, a retainer
of the law, and a hackney writer. As no
attempt was made to prove whether he wrote by instigation,
it remained problematic. Certain it is, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
he soon afterwards attached himself to the Earl of
Northumberland.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p>

<p>On the 21st, Lord Lyttelton made his complaint,
and moved for a censure of the book as Jacobitical,
and violating the Bill of Rights, and the Revolution.
Ministers, he said, ought to have taken notice of it;
but they who had fallen so severely on seditious
pamphlets, had overlooked this tract, so subversive of
all liberty. Lord Dartmouth treated the book with
still more severity. Lord Halifax affected to go
farther, but complained of Lord Lyttelton for not
acquainting him with his intention. Lord Marchmont
to the censure proposed to tack a compliment to the
King on his love of liberty; for so servile are some
men, that they cannot condemn flattery without
making use of it.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> The book, thus attacked on one
side and given up on the other, was sentenced to be
burnt, and the author ordered to be taken into custody.
The latter part of the sentence nobody took
any pains to execute.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the Lords communicated their resolutions
to the other House, who concurred in the same
judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
On February the 21st, Sir John Philipps, as he had
before acquainted the House he would, moved for
leave to bring in a bill to ascertain the power of
Secretaries of State in granting warrants—a line
almost impossible to draw. Treason was to be kept
in awe on one side; the Ministers themselves on the
other. Nor could this boon to liberty but be suspicious
when offered by a hand so rankly Jacobite!
The Ministers had made their use of the idea, and
desired no such bill: and the Opposition were not
forward to let them draw such a bill. It was therefore
dropped with scorn by both sides of the House;
and yet the Court afterwards affected to talk of this
bill as a tender made to liberty, and rejected by its
advocates.</p>

<p>The same day was Wilkes found guilty in the King’s
Bench, of being author of the North Briton, and of
the Essay on Woman.</p>

<p>The City of London, to honour the steadiness and
services of Mr. Pratt, the other Chief Justice, presented
him with the freedom of the City, and thanked
their own Representatives for their behaviour on the
question of the warrants.</p>

<p>On the 6th of March, it was agreed to amend the
Marriage bill by another bill, as Mr. Yorke had proposed:
and the same day died his father, and the
father of the Bill, Philip Earl of Hardwicke; a man
who, during his power, had coloured over very confined
parts, and very few virtues, with a gravity that
was construed into both, as it served the purpose of
himself or his dependents. Pride, revenge, and avarice
were his true features; and whatever pictures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
shall be drawn of him where those lines do not predominate,
will be unlike, false, and flattering. To conceal
all knowledge of his vast wealth, his sons did not
prove his will till the memory of him was faded
away.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></p>

<p class="hang b2">The Earl of Egmont.—The Budget.—Taxation of the American
Colonies.—New Bridge at Blackfriars.—Appearance of the “Lettres,
Mémoires, et Négotiations du Chevalier d’Eon,” &amp;c.—Lord
Clive appointed Governor General of India.—Contest at Cambridge.—Philip
Earl of Hardwicke.—Jeremiah Dyson.</p></blockquote>

<p>While men were taken up with the politics of the
age, there was a Minister so smitten with the exploded
usages of barbarous times, that he thought of nothing
less than reviving the feudal system. This was the
Earl of Egmont,<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> who had actually drawn up a plan
for establishing that absurd kind of government in the
island of St. John.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> He printed several copies of his
scheme, and sent them about to his brother peers.
And so little were they masters of the subject, and so
great was the inattention of the Ministry to the outlying
parts of our empire, that his Lordship, in the
following year, had prevailed with the Council to suffer
him to make the experiment, if General Conway had
not chanced to arrive at Council and expose the folly
of such an undertaking, which occasioned its being
laid aside. Lord Egmont was such a passionate admirer
of those noble tenures and customs, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
rebuilt his house at Enmere in Somersetshire in the
guise of a castle, moated it round, and prepared it to
defend itself with cross-bows and arrows, against the
time in which the fabric and use of gunpowder shall
be forgotten.</p>

<p>On the 9th Mr. Grenville opened the budget, fully,
for brevity was not his failing; but he did it with art
and ability too, though not disguising how much he
was hurt by abuse. He said it had been written in
pamphlets that 400,000<i>l.</i> a year was dealt out in
pensions; pretending that the accusation had been
levelled against the profusion of those granted in
Ireland, which he denied to be so great as alleged,
particularly in that bestowed on Lord Sandwich, which,
as I have said, had been stopped. But in truth the
charge had been levelled against that sort of corruption
in England; and on that he chose to be silent. Much
art, he said, had been used to dissuade people from
subscribing to the loans of Government; but no new
money was to be raised,—no lottery; the latter to be
kept in reserve for another exigence. He hoped,
therefore, people would engage in the funds, as if
monied men would not keep their cash a year longer,
when it must be borrowed! He took great merit on
the revenue being managed with more frugality than
in the late reign, and on the increase of the customs,
particularly in the duties on tea, though the increase
of trade had much more share in that rise than his
regulations. He stated the debt incurred by the late
war at sixty-four millions already funded, and nine
that were not. But above all he praised, and justly,
the reduction of the demands from Germany. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
amounted to 1,354,803<i>l.</i> and upwards, of which
103,355<i>l.</i> had only been allowed. 263,211<i>l.</i> had been
suspended, and 988,237<i>l.</i><a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> had been struck off. The
time had been limited for the demands to be brought
in, or more would have been asked from that quarter:
and yet our taxes, he said, exceeded by three millions
what they did in 1754. He then opened his, famous
shall I call it, or fatal, plan for collecting a revenue
from America;<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> a plan which, though it took place in
the session I am describing, I will not unfold here;
for though the regulation was enacted now, the consequences
did not appear to this country till the winter
following. I shall be obliged to say so much on
that head hereafter, that to avoid repetition, and to
introduce the detail where it will come in with more
propriety, and be more useful to the reader, I shall
pass it over now;—and would to God that at the
moment I am writing, at the end of 1768, the subject
was not only fresh, but threatening a scene of long and
terrible calamity both to England and her colonies!
His object, he said, was to make them maintain their
own army. Till the last war they had never contributed
to their army at all. The extraordinaries of the
American war had cost England 36,000<i>l.</i> a year. He
had, additionally, a plan for preventing the colonies
from trading directly to France, Holland, Portugal, or
the French islands. Thus did this pedlar in revenue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
confound the tranquillity both of America and Great
Britain; and to realize farthings, set both countries at
variance, at the risk of treasure, human lives, liberty,
and common and mutual preservation.</p>

<p>On the 12th, at the East India House, which had
been a theatre of disputes and clashing interests, Mr.
Amyand,<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> having quarrelled with Sullivan, the leader
of the faction opposite to Lord Clive, suddenly proposed
to give the government of Bengal, with full
powers over their affairs, to that Lord, if he would
undertake the commission. Lord Clive, then present,
said, this motion was totally unexpected; yet would
he accept the offer, if a board of directors on whom
he could depend should be chosen. The election was
then at hand. The train caught so rapidly, that it was
proposed directly to invest him with his jaguire, which
had been voted as precipitately too, if somebody<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> had
not observed that a lawsuit being commenced on that
subject, the law must decide it.</p>

<p>The City of London applied to Parliament for more
money for their new bridge at Blackfriars. James<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
Grenville objected to it. Dr. Hay broke out and
abused the Common Council, whose late behaviour, he
said, entitled them to no favour. He alluded to their
thanking their members for voting against general
warrants. This produced as warm language in return
from Beckford and Onslow. George Grenville interposed,
and said, the question was not whether the City
deserved money, but whether it could be afforded.
That their temporary bridge having been burnt by accident,
they ought to have a gift of six or seven thousand
pounds. Sir William Baker<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> in disdain moved
to adjourn, that they might not accept it.</p>

<p>The printers of the London Evening Post and Gazetteer
were called before the House of Lords, on a
complaint made by the Earl of Marchmont, for printing
a letter (written by Wilkes) reflecting on the Earl
of Hertford, ambassador at Paris, for employing David
Hume the historian as his secretary, and representing
the embassy as totally of Scotch complexion. Wilkes,
then an outlaw, and in France, had gone to the Earl’s
chapel, who treated him civilly, but neither returned
his visits nor invited him to dinner, which it was impossible
he should do, representing the person of the
King so grievously outraged by that libeller. Lord
Marchmont proposed to inflict a fine of 100<i>l.</i> on each
printer. Lord Weymouth said fifty were sufficient;
not more had been imposed on a printer of a spurious
speech for the King. Lord Temple put them in mind
how much himself and the Duke of Cumberland had
been abused; and in answer to the Duke of Bedford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
who had complained that names were now printed at
length, said, that practice had been begun when himself
and Mr. Pitt had resigned the last time. The
Duke of Richmond said, he remembered that the
period in which the Duke of Cumberland had been
most traduced, was in the year 1757. Lord Temple
and Mr. Pitt were then in power. The truth was, no
side had abstained from invectives when out of place.
The difference was, that no attempt was made to
punish the authors and printers but under the administration
of Grenville, Lord Sandwich, and that set.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of March appeared one of the most
extraordinary books ever published, and though written
by a foreigner, and in French, by no means inferior
in detraction to the North Britons. It was a large
quarto, called <cite>Lettres, Mémoires, et Négotiations particulières
du Chevalier d’Eon</cite>, &amp;c.: and contained the
history of his employments, troubles, quarrel with
Monsieur de Guerchy, and his own wonderfully imprudent
and insolent letters to the Duc de Praslin,
the second Minister in power at the Court at Versailles.
The contempt expressed for the Comte de
Guerchy was transcendant; but yet this was not the
most reprehensible part of the work. With the most
indefensible wantonness, D’Eon had inserted the childishly
fond, but friendly letters, of his patron the Duc
de Nivernois. With still greater indiscretion, he
published others of an intimate friend employed in the
office of the Secretary of State at Versailles, in which
that friend, in confidence, had familiarly censured his
masters: and with the most abominable treachery
D’Eon added confidential letters between the Ducs de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
Nivernois and Praslin, in which, though with goodwill
towards <em>him</em>, they spoke of their intimate friend
Monsieur de Guerchy with much contemptuous pity,
which might be excused between such near friends,
though never to be pardoned by Guerchy. These
letters D’Eon, when trusted with the Duc de Nivernois’s
keys, had stolen or copied. To such lengths
blind, headstrong revenge had driven the mad, unprincipled
wretch! But what satisfaction did it create
here, to read, under the hands of the chief Ministers
in France, to how low an ebb that Court was sunk
in abilities! the two Dukes owning to one another
that their poor Guerchy, as they called him, was yet
the fittest man they had to employ. Among such a
heap of baseness great parts appeared; and it seemed
lucky for his Court that a man so likely to be raised,
and so capable of any treachery, unbosomed himself
before he was possessed of more important secrets.
In some instances, as in a letter to his mother, D’Eon
seemed to have worked himself up to a pitch of frenzy;
throughout, to be swayed by intolerable vanity.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
blow to Guerchy was heavy and cruel; and scarcely
less mortifying to the Duc de Nivernois. Praslin, a
hard, unfeeling man, took it with implacable resentment;
and yet, in one respect, acted sensibly and
honourably: instead of ruining St. Foix, the person
whose letters D’Eon had, unprovoked and wickedly,
disclosed, he was preferred, and never suffered any
marks of his master’s displeasure. Every possible
attention was employed here to console M. de Guerchy,
and to prevent his thinking that he was lowered in
the public esteem; but was it, alas! possible he could
believe so? The other foreign Ministers demanded
satisfaction for so gross an insult on one of their order;
and the Court was willing enough to grant any reparation
in its power. But what reparation could it
make proportioned to the offence? All it could, it
did. The Attorney-General was ordered to file an
information against D’Eon for a libel.</p>

<p>The imbecility of the Opposition, notwithstanding
the large accession to their numbers on the question
of the warrants, had left the Ministry in possession
of full power. The sense of the nation had in vain
appeared to be averse to them. It still continued so,
wherever its genuine voice could be heard: and never
more than on the following occasion. The death of
the Earl of Hardwicke had left open the honour of
High Steward in the University of Cambridge. Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
Sandwich, on the prospect of that event, had declared
himself a candidate for that office, though attended
with neither salary nor power. Lord Royston,
son of the deceased and now Earl of Hardwicke, was
his competitor. Ambitious industry was never exerted
so indefatigably as by Sandwich on this occasion.
There was not a corner of England, nay, not the Isle
of Man, unransacked by him for votes. He ferreted
out the mad, the lame, the diseased, from their poor
retreats, and imported them into the University.
Letters on letters were written, and fawning applications
made to all who could influence a vote of any
country clergyman. Lord Hardwicke, on the other
hand, was cold, proud, and void of generosity.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> With
the clergy, indeed, he had much connection: and,
being a man of no vice, and by poring over historic
MSS., supposed to be learned, he seemed adapted to
fill a nominal charge in a society that is expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
to be devout and studious. At least, the profligacy of
Sandwich could not but be unsuitable to them, whether
they had the reality, or only the semblance of religion
and learning. When the day of election came on, the
votes appeared to be equal, though each side pretended
to have a majority of one. Great altercations
ensued, and the meeting broke up in confusion; on
which recourse was had to common law, where, after
many months, a decision was pronounced in favour of
Lord Hardwicke. Many instances appeared of bribery
practised by Lord Sandwich; who, besides being rejected,
experienced many insults and indignities. The
under-graduates who, having no votes, had not been
courted by him, were riotous, and hissed his chief
agents: and when he went to the University in the
month following, and dined in the hall of Trinity
College, they marked their abhorrence of him by
quitting the hall, and refusing to dine with him!
Young Thomas Pitt,<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> and Frederick Montagu,<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> Sandwich’s
own cousin, who had gone down to support him,
were so disgusted with his practices, and with the
factious confusion he had caused in the University,
that they declared they would assist his cause no
longer. When the former told him he would ruin
the University, he replied, “That would be nothing
to him: it would be the better for Oxford.” Yet
himself had been bred at Cambridge—but Oxford was
cherished by the Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
On the 12th of April came on the election of East
India Directors, when Sullivan’s list was chosen,
though Clive had the support not only of the Administration,
but of the Duke of Devonshire.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> Sullivan
himself was elected by a majority of but one vote.
He thought that in the new Direction he had twelve
votes to ten; but before the day of their balloting
for their chairman, Lord Clive had bought off one of
them. When the election came on, Sullivan desired
to be named without being obliged to submit to a
ballot, at the same time cajoling the other party with
great professions to Lord Clive. His antagonists,
however, insisting on a ballot, the numbers appeared
to be eleven and eleven. Sullivan finding himself
betrayed or overreached, retired with heat, and Rous,
his principal enemy, was chosen chairman. Had Sullivan,
who was the creature of Lord Shelburne, succeeded,
Colonel Barré was to have gone Governor to
Bengal, which was given to Lord Clive, and he was
soon after decorated with the Order of the Bath, to
give dignity to his new employment.</p>

<p>At the same time, to mark that Parliamentary services
or disobedience were the leading steps to favour
or disgrace, Mr. Bridgman<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> was turned out of the
Board of Greencloth for his vote on General Warrants;
and was succeeded by Richard Vernon,<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> formerly an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
officer, a jockey, a gamester, and brother-in-law of the
Duchess of Bedford. Mr. Cadogan<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a> was appointed
Surveyor of the Royal Gardens; and Jeremiah Dyson
was made one of the Lords of Trade. Of this man it
is necessary to say a few more words. He was a
tailor’s son, had risen under Nicholas Hardinge from a
subaltern clerk of the House of Commons, to succeed
him as first clerk, and by education and principle was
thought and had conversed as a staunch Republican.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a>
In that employment he had comported himself with
singular decency and intelligence. In truth his parts
were excellent: he was quick, subtle, shrewd, clear,
both in conception and delivery, and was master of
argumentative eloquence, though void of every ornamental
part of it. Being of an unhealthy complexion,
and very fretful temper, he had quitted his laborious
post, and was now come into Parliament, secretly sold
to the Favourite; but from his behaviour as their clerk,
having conciliated much goodwill to himself among
the members, he was for some time heard with great
favour and satisfaction, an indulgence he lost afterwards,
when his warmth made them recollect he
had once been their servant. He now appeared as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
devoted to George Grenville, and indeed was excellently
useful, from his parts and great knowledge of
Parliamentary business, to all who employed him.
But proving both slippery to his friends as fast as they
fell, and vexatious to his enemies, few men became
equally unpopular. Having deserted Grenville on a
change of times, and happening to convert his tied
wig into a bag, Lord Gower being asked the reason,
said, “It is because no <em>Tye</em> will hold him.”<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> Dyson
will appear again on the stage in a critical moment.</p>

the legality of General Warrants.—Trial of Carteret Webbe for
Perjury.—The Earl of Northumberland Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 19th the Parliament rose. And now it is
that I am obliged to weave the history of my own
conduct into a large part of the following narration.
Two considerable eras having taken their complexion
from my councils, the thread of my story would be
imperfect, if I omitted what relates to my own behaviour.
I shall give it as briefly as the subject and
clearness will permit, and hope the reader will excuse
egotisms where no glory was the result of my actions.
Chance, more than design, presented the means; and
if the moments were luckily seized, it was from no
merit, no foresight of mine, that those moments were
brought on.</p>

<p>Having fully seen the incapacity of the Opposition,
sensible how ill they were united, and foreseeing that
their strength would rather diminish than augment,
and at the same time flattering myself, from the resistance
which the Ministry had experienced, that they
would be less flippant in their innovations on liberty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
which was fortified by getting rid of general warrants,
I had determined to give over politics; and to withdraw
myself from shallow councils. I was preparing
to make a visit to my friend and relation,<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> Lord Hertford,
at Paris, when, two days after the rising of the
Parliament, I was stunned with notice of Mr. Conway
being turned out of the King’s bedchamber, and dismissed
from the command of his regiment of dragoons.
As <em>I</em> had been a principal cause of this
unworthy treatment, and of this destruction of his
fortunes, nothing could be more sensible to me than
this blow. Nor could I remain a moment in doubt,
from the complexion of some in power, but that the
stroke was aimed still more at me than at Mr.
Conway, though directly I was out of their reach.
The Bedford faction I knew were my mortal enemies.
Yet I saw, too, that Mr. Conway had a share in the
resentment of others. Grenville was not of a nature
to pardon the slight Mr. Conway had made both of
his favour and power. He had offended Lord Sandwich,
too, by refusing to influence the chaplain of his
regiment to vote for him at Cambridge; and Lord
Holland had long groaned for an opportunity of
revenging himself on Lord Hertford for his treatment
of Bunbury. The tone of the ruling Administration
was despotic, nor had they forgotten how
lately they had trembled with apprehension of losing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
their power. Here were more than motives sufficient
to egg on general or particular vengeance. And in
general I must leave it; for after long search and
much information, I cannot fix the deed on any single
man. There was but one man among the suspected
that ever solemnly denied having a share in it; and
he constantly did: I mean Lord Bute. All the rest
have charged it on others, though still without disavowing
having had a hand in it themselves. The
King often afterwards protested to Lord Hertford
that his Ministers<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> forced him to it. Grenville declared
that his Majesty was more eager for it than
any of them. The Duke of Bedford alone was frank,
and avowed that though he had not recommended the
measure, he had told his colleagues, when they proposed
to remove Mr. Conway from the bedchamber
only, that it was foolish to provoke him by halves; and
that to leave him his regiment, and take away the
bedchamber, would be telling other officers that they
might oppose the Court with impunity.</p>

<p>Be it as it may, the boldness of the step was almost
unprecedented. Sir Robert Walpole had dismissed
the Lords Westmoreland<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> and Cobham<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> from the command
of regiments; and Mr. Pitt from a cornetcy;
but it was not till by a personal, violent, and constant
opposition, that they had made themselves as obnoxious
as possible. Yet even that measure, provoked
as it was, had occasioned great clamour; and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
contributed to animate the Opposition, which at last
overthrew that Minister. Mr. Grenville had joined
in that Opposition, had risen on that foundation; and
the Duke of Bedford had signed a protest against
the measure of dismissing officers for parliamentary
reasons. How different was the case now! The
temper and fairness of the man disgraced, his aversion
to faction, the disinterestedness of his character, his
general co-operation with the measures of Government,
his being recently recommended to favour by Prince
Ferdinand for his services in Germany, and his being
brother to the ambassador at Paris—all these were
considerations that made the measure amazing. But
when it was observed that this punishment was inflicted
for a single<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> vote in Parliament, when it was
evident that that vote had been peculiarly conscientious,
and given in a cause avowed by the nation,
and against a practice certain of being, as it soon
after was, condemned by the Courts of Law, and
though maintained by Parliament in retrospect, yet
given up for the future by that very Parliament as
pernicious; when the context, too, appeared to be,
that military men in Parliament were to forfeit their
profession and the merit of their services, unless implicitly
devoted to the Court; could these reflections,
when coupled with the arbitrary measures which the
nation had observed to be the system of the Court,
fail to occasion the blackest presages? Lord Bute,
in truth, had slunk away from his own victory; but
Grenville remained, and had Bute’s tools, and Sandwich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
and Rigby, to war with on the constitution, and
Lord Mansfield and Norton ready to turn the law
against itself.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful contrast, the behaviour of the
person aggrieved. His temper, decency, and submission
were unalterable and unequalled. He neither
complained nor tried to instil a sense of his injuries
into a single friend, though he wished they should
take his part, and resent for him. He could not have
entertained a wish worse founded: his friends were
rejoiced at not being called upon; and had no ambition
to share the crown of his martyrdom. There
lived not three more interested men than the Duke
of Argyle,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> Lord Lorn, and Lord Frederick Campbell,
the father and brothers of Lady Ailesbury,<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> Mr. Conway’s
wife. The first loved money, and had incurred
unpleasant suspicions in his efforts to obtain it. Lord
Lorn<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> was sordidly covetous, and had not sense enough
to foresee a blessing in futurity beyond the first half-crown
that glittered in his eyes. Lord Frederick<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
sensible, shrewd, and selfish; and on this and a subsequent
crisis showed that no connection or obligation
could stand against the eagerness with which he
pursued immediate fortune. Nothing else weighed
with him, except the inveteracy of national prejudice.
As Mr. Conway had acted in opposition to Scottish
measures, Lord Frederick, forgetting Mr. Conway’s
friendship and kindness, and his own youthful situation,
and borne away by a hot temper, often and indecently
attacked him in Parliament, though without
any brilliancy of parts to colour over such improper
behaviour. The Duke of Richmond, who had married
Lady Ailesbury’s daughter, kept himself more free
from blame. He had been witness to the integrity of
Mr. Conway’s conduct at the conference with Mr.
Grenville, and certainly loved him, though not enough
to participate his disgrace. The Duke, however, offered
to take a part in Parliament if Mr. Conway’s
friends would move for an inquiry into the cause of
his dismission; but that offer did not include his
Grace’s engaging any farther against the Court.</p>

<p>There was still another relation of Mr. Conway
more deeply involved in his disgrace, and more immediately
called upon to resent it; his brother, Lord
Hertford. Yet there were both real and specious
reasons for his submitting to it.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> Mr. Conway had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
taken this part, not only without consulting him, but
when he must have known how unwelcome it would
be to Lord Hertford, then in the King’s service both
at home and abroad, and well treated; connected with
the Ministry, and ever desirous of being so with all
Administrations. Lord Hertford had even, after his
brother’s first vote, made remonstrances to him, though
in vain. On the other hand, honour, interest in a
general sense, and personal resentment, called on Lord
Hertford to espouse his brother’s quarrel. Ambassador
in France, where no officer was ever broken but
for cowardice or some atrocious crime, it could but
strike the French Court that the Ambassador stood
in little estimation at home, when such an affront was
put on the family. Could he expect more consideration
if he acquiesced? On the other hand, should
the Opposition succeed, in which, besides his brother,
were his wife’s nephew, the Duke of Grafton,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> and his
old friends, whom he had already offended by not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
acting with them, what could he expect but, at best,
the humiliating circumstance of being saved by his
brother whom he had abandoned? Nor could Lord
Hertford doubt but that Mr. Conway partly suffered
on his account, as far as Lord Holland had any share
in the measure. Yet, though there had been no instance
of such a disgrace remaining unresented, much
less when such a character was so unjustly treated, not
a single resignation marked that the sufferer had
either a friend or relation in the place. He was at
once sacrificed by the Court, and abandoned by his
own family.</p>

<p>It became the more incumbent on me to make him
all the reparation in my power. I offered him six
thousand pounds, which he refused; and I altered my
will, giving him almost my whole fortune unless his
regiment should be restored to him; a destination
with which I acquainted him. And though it certainly
would not augment the gift, I determined to
hazard all I had rather than not revenge both him and
myself. Grenville, the very day before the dismission
of Mr. Conway, whether to detach me from him, or
fearing I should make use of the indiscretion he had
been guilty of, ordered the payment of my bills at the
Treasury; a step that, far from soothing, but served to
increase my resentment. I dreaded lest Mr. Conway
should think I had kept any underhand measures with
the Treasury; but I soon convinced both him and the
world how steadily I embraced the cause of my friend.
Yet for the first time in my life I acted with a phlegm
of which I did not know myself capable. I shut myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
up in the country for three days, till I had conquered
the first ebullitions of my rage, and then returned
to town with a face of satisfaction, which some
thought indifference; and others joy at having dipped
Mr. Conway in Opposition. Both were mistaken. I
knew that both Mr. Conway and the Opposition were
little formed for the business. I had everything to
discourage me, and nothing but perseverance and the
firmness of my own temper to carry me on. I foresaw,
indeed, that the persecution he had undergone would
raise the character of Mr. Conway, would lend him an
importance he would never have assumed, and might
one day place him at the head of this country. I foresaw
that the violence and unprincipled rashness of the
Ministers would conduct them to a precipice; but I
should far overrate my own sagacity, if I pretended to
have discovered that those prospects were near enough
to administer any comfort to my impatience. I knew
the folly of those I was to act with. I could not flatter
myself it would be exceeded by the folly of those
I was to act against.</p>

<p>If self-interest restrained Mr. Conway’s family from
embracing his defence, it was as natural that the Opposition
should caress him. A martyr is as creditable
to a party in politics as to a sect in religion. Yet so
decent and so dignified was the Opposition of that
time, that they expressed none of the heat and ardour
with which parties usually seize such an event. The
Duke of Devonshire, indeed, came to me, and with
great delicacy desired that I would in his name make
an offer to Mr. Conway of a thousand pounds a year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
till his regiment should be restored.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> This noble offer
Mr. Conway as generously declined. However, it
gave lustre to our cause; and it was my purpose to
raise as high as I could the character of our party, and
to spread the flames of emulation from such examples.
The Ministerial tools, on the other hand, were not idle,
but began to defame Mr. Conway as a spiritless and
inactive General, reviving in scandalous papers the
miscarriage at Rochfort.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> This artillery, however, we
turned upon them, and displayed the malignity of not
being content with ruining him, without proceeding
to the grossest defamation. Mr. Conway, too, by my
advice, called upon the detractors to avow themselves,
and, if they dared, take up the weapons like men,
which soon silenced that dirty kind of war.</p>

<p>But these prosperous beginnings were almost all I
could accomplish. Every step I took I found discouragement
and disappointment. There was no union
in our party, nor could I bring about any. At first I
laboured to form a little junto of the most considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
of our friends in the House of Commons, who should
plan our future measures and conduct them. But of
those I could not prevail on any three to assemble and
enter into concert. Legge was dying; Charles Yorke
was proud, insincere, waiting for an opportunity of
making his own bargain, and offended that Mr. Pitt
was disposed to make Pratt Chancellor; though the
latter, for the good of the cause, was willing to waive
the Seals. Charles Townshend, neglected by the Court,
seemed zealously attached to us; unfortunately, we
could neither do with him nor without him; yet his
jealousy of Grenville and fear of Mr. Conway would
have fixed him, if anything could. There was another
man of whose art and abilities I had a high opinion,
and who was as practicable as the others I have mentioned
were little so,—I mean Lord George Sackville.
But insuperable difficulties kept him from us too.
Pitt had proscribed him; Newcastle did not love him;
the Duke of Devonshire was too cautious to join him;
and Conway, knowing Lord George had been his enemy,
though it had never come to an open rupture,
would not listen to any connection with him, but
pleaded the stains on his character, and the enmity
borne to him by Prince Ferdinand. I lost my temper
at finding that, whilst our enemies stuck at nothing,
every phantom and every fancy was to clog our councils
and retard our advances. The dignity of great
Lords, and their want of sense, the treachery of some,
the piques of others, all had their operation, and not a
single prejudice was removed to facilitate our attempts.
I had surmounted my repugnance to Newcastle, and,
though in truth to little purpose, had consented to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
advise with him. He was still the same; at once busy
and inactive, fond of plotting, but impossible to be
put in motion. Nor, indeed, propose what I would,
could I obtain to have a single measure carried into
execution.</p>

<p>But what hampered us most was Mr. Pitt. He
justly resented having been abandoned by Newcastle,
Devonshire, and the Whigs. He despised both
Charles Yorke and Charles Townshend; and though he
expressed civil applause of Mr. Conway, would neither
connect with him nor see him. He at once talked
of an Administration to be composed of great Whig
Lords, and of his own resolution not to force himself
on the King; that is, he wished the great Lords
should force him on the King without his concurrence,
that he might have the merit of disavowing them, and
of profiting of their weight. Conway was as difficult
as Pitt, and too proud to make any advances to him.
Thus, wherever I turned, there were no facilities.
Even Lord Temple, accustomed to run and meet faction
in the highways, seemed cold and indisposed to
connection with us. At the same time I heard that a
treaty was carrying on between him and his brother
George; a report which, though true, greatly deceived
me; for, concluding that Lord Temple was too firmly
united with Mr. Pitt to negotiate without him, I imputed
the coldness of both to an approaching league
of the whole family; whereas the truth was, though
then a secret to all the world, that Mr. Pitt and Lord
Temple were on bad terms; the former disapproving
the violence of Temple; and Temple being enraged
that Mr. Pitt would not lend himself to all his passions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
Perceiving so little hope of union amongst ourselves,
I conceived a better prospect from the factions of the
Court, which, by every art I could devise, I endeavoured
to inflame. I soon learned how wide the
breach was growing between Lord Bute and Grenville;
and though I then looked on the former as the
more dangerous of the two, and of all men was determined
not to connect with him; yet to his friends I
held a plausible language, insinuating that it was
possible he might be forgiven by our great Lords, and
left them to think that, if the Favourite withdrew his
protection from Grenville and the Bedfords, his case
would by no means be desperate with the Opposition.
In the same kind of style I talked to the friends of
Grenville; still imputing Mr. Conway’s disgrace alternately
to the other faction, accordingly as I conversed
with either. I saw that, hostile as they were, despair
must cement their union. Both would be more prompt
to quarrel if they thought themselves not proscribed
by us.</p>

<p>An incident fell out favourable to this plan. Grenville,
ever averse to Lord Holland, had destined his
place of Paymaster to be shared between Lord North
and Stanley, and they had even taken joy on it. But
Lord Bute had prevented it being carried into execution;
and Lord Holland now came from France,
stung with this insult: though as the passing of his
accounts was in agitation, he for the present stifled his
resentment, and affected to pay court to Grenville. As,
however, to hoodwink me to his own share in that
business, and to inflame my anger to Grenville, he
laid the chief blame of Conway’s disgrace on the latter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
I indulged him, as usual, in the imagination that he deceived
me; and, as if to vent my own passion, blew up
his as high as I could against Grenville. From Lord
Holland I heard what had escaped me. Conway at
the end of the Session, on a motion for thanking the
King for reducing the German demand, had made a
panegyric on Prince Ferdinand and the hereditary
Prince, saying how hard it was that <em>their</em> country,
which had suffered so much for <em>us</em>, should not have
ample indemnification. Grenville had answered, that
surely if the King had been content to lower the
demands for Hanover, he was at liberty to reduce those
of Brunswick. This had passed in a thin debate; nor
had I been present. But Lord George Sackville had
remarked, and said, “Conway has undone himself.” It
was, it seems, an irremissible crime to applaud the
hero who had commanded our armies and given them
victory; and to plead for another hero who had married
the King’s own sister and fought his battles!</p>

<p>I shall omit the detail of many other stratagems
that I formed for annoying the Administration, they
having been damped or annihilated by the supineness
of my confederates. The summer was in every respect
unfortunate to us; and by the Session following,
we scarce deserved the name of a party. Death took
off some of our chief leaders, who, though they would
not lead us, yet, by the sanction of their names,
had kept together an appearance of numbers, which
dwindled away as our hopes of success vanished.
What farther regards us as a party will be mentioned
in its place. I now return to the other occurrences of
the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
Two vacant garters were bestowed on the Duke of
Mecklenberg<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> and Lord Halifax. About the same
time died at Paris the King’s mistress, Madame de
Pompadour. She retained her power to the last,
though their amour had long been exhausted. The
Duc de Choiseul, whom she had destined for Minister,
succeeded her in the King’s confidence without
a rival.</p>

<p>May 4th, Beardmore, one of the persecuted writers,
carried his cause against the messengers, and recovered
one thousand pounds for damages.</p>

<p>On the 9th Mr. Conway’s late regiment was given
to the Earl of Pembroke; not without occasioning remarks
a little disadvantageous to the standard of his
Majesty’s piety. Lord Pembroke, one of the wildest
young men of the times, had been dismissed from the
King’s bedchamber for debauching and eloping with
a young lady of distinction, though married to a more
beautiful woman, sister of the Duke of Marlborough.
Nobody could tell what the King had to do to interfere
in that intrigue: but having done so, it seemed
little consistent to reward a young profligate<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> with the
spoils of a man strictly virtuous and conscientious.
It was now remembered that at the beginning of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
reign, the Earl of Dartmouth, a young nobleman as
pious as Lord Pembroke was licentious, had applied
to be of the King’s bedchamber, but had been rejected
by Lord Bute, lest so sanctimonious a man should
gain too far on his Majesty’s piety. An instance that
if it proved the religion of the King, did not bear
witness to that of the Favourite. But in such a theatre
of hypocrisy, it mattered little who was the principal
impostor.</p>

<p>On the 15th died Dr. Osbaldiston, Bishop of London;
and the next day Lord Chancellor Henley was
created Earl of Northington, a step not communicated
to the Duke of Bedford, who much resented it.
But Grenville was more mortified, who found himself
excluded from the nomination of the new Bishop of
London. He had wished to raise Newton<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> to that
mitre, but Lord Bute procured it for Terrick. This
man, with no glimmering of parts or knowledge, had,
on the merit of a sonorous delivery, and by an assiduity
of back-stairs address, wriggled himself into a
sort of general favour; and by timing his visits luckily,
had been promoted by the Duke of Devonshire to the
See of Peterborough. Yet he had been of the first,
notoriously obliged to that Duke, to abandon him on
his fall, sailing headlong with the tide after the Favourite’s
triumph. Again, when the Favourite retired,
Terrick, who was minister of my parish,<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> was lavish
to me of invectives against that Lord; and sifted me
eagerly to learn in what channel Court favour was
likely to flow. Having soon perceived his mistake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
he had made out a distant affinity with Worseley,<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> a
creature of Lord Bute, and a kind of riding-master
to the King; and now to Grenville’s surprise rose,
all unworthy as he was, to so eminent a station
in the Church. This detail I communicated to Dr.
Lyttelton, Bishop of Carlisle, who adhered to George
Grenville amidst their family breaches; and who, being
both gossiping and mischievous, kept up an acquaintance
with me of ancient date, that he might
from my warmth collect materials to carry to Grenville.
I took care to furnish him according to his
wish. It was wormwood to Grenville to learn this
proof of the Favourite’s still subsisting ascendant; and
when I had once set them on the scent, I knew they
would touch on it in more instances than this.</p>

<p>On the 22nd Philip Carteret Webbe was tried for
perjury, being accused of having forsworn himself in
the cause against Wilkes. The jury stayed out fifty-five
minutes, but at last acquitted him: a vindication
that no more cleared his character than conviction
would have made it worse.</p>

<p>The Earl of Northumberland<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> returned from Ireland,
where his profusion and ostentation had been so great,<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a>
that it seemed to lay a dangerous precedent for succeeding
governors, who must risk unpopularity if more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
parsimonious; or the ruin of their fortune, should they
imitate his example. At his departure he broke with
William Gerard Hamilton,<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> his secretary, and dismissed
him to make way for the Earl of Drogheda,<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a>
the favourite both of Lady Northumberland and the
Primate.</p>

<p>Lord Northumberland had an advantageous figure
and much courtesy in his address, which being supported
by the most expensive magnificence, made him
exceedingly popular with the meaner sort. They who
viewed him nearer, were not the dupes of his affability
or pretensions. The old nobility beheld his pride with
envy and anger; and thence were the less disposed to
overlook the littleness of his temper, or the slender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
portion he possessed of abilities; for his expense was
a mere sacrifice to vanity, as appeared by his sordid
and illiberal behaviour at play. Nor were his talents
more solid than his generosity. With mechanic application
to every branch of knowledge, he possessed
none beyond the surface; and having an unbounded
propensity to discussion, he disgusted his hearers without
informing them. Yet his equals were but ill-grounded
in their contempt of him. Very few of them
knew so much; and there were still fewer that had
not more noxious vices, and as ungenerous hearts.
Lord Northumberland’s foibles ought to have passed
almost for virtues in an age so destitute of intrinsic
merit.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a></p>

<p>The Countess of Northumberland was a jovial heap
of contradictions. The blood of all the Percies and
Seymours swelled in her veins and in her fancy; while
her person was more vulgar than anything but her
conversation, which was larded indiscriminately with
stories of her ancestors and her footmen. Show, and
crowds, and junketting, were her endless pursuits.
She was familiar with the mob, while stifled with diamonds;
and yet was attentive to the most minute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
privileges of her rank, while almost shaking hands with
a cobbler. Nothing was more mean than her assiduity
about the King and Queen, whom she termed her
<em>Master</em> and <em>Mistress</em>; and yet, though indirectly reprimanded
by the latter, she persisted in following her
Majesty to the theatres with a longer retinue of domestics
than waited on the Queen herself. She had
revived the drummers and pipers and obsolete minstrels
of her family; and her own buxom countenance
at the tail of such a procession, gave it all the air of
an antiquated pageant or mumming. She was mischievous
under the appearance of frankness; generous
and friendly without delicacy or sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p>

<p>Lord Northumberland’s son, Lord Warkworth, was
married to the third daughter of the Favourite;<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> on
which foundation the father was admitted to the private
junto, which now met daily at Mr. Stone’s.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> It
was composed of Lord Bute, Lord Northumberland,
Lord Mansfield, Norton, Stone, and the brother of the
latter, the famous Primate of Ireland, who bad followed
the Lord-Lieutenant to London; coming, as he outwardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
professed, to promote harmony and reconciliation.
As he died soon after, before he had given any
specimens of his arts here, I pretend not to say what
were the real motives of his journey. He did visit
Mr. Pitt; but a man so notorious for cunning as the
Primate, was not likely to win on the <em>caution</em> of Mr.
Pitt, who never <em>was explicit</em>, and least of all to men of
abilities. It appeared, however, from the meetings
I have mentioned, and other symptoms, that the Favourite
was peeping out of his lurking-hole, and was
disposed to let his power be felt. Grenville, though
drunk with vanity, was sober enough to be stung with
any competition; and yet his obstinacy disgusted those
whom it was most necessary for him to attach. He
offended the Duke of Bedford and Lord Halifax by
refusing to let the Treasury bear the whole charge of
the fines imposed on the messengers. The Duke experienced
so many slights, that he kept retired in the
country, and Rigby went to France, professing that
it was to be absent, lest he should be blamed if the
Duke should submit to such ignominious treatment;
but Rigby had, no doubt, secured the Duke’s submission
before he ventured to leave him, as he called it,
to himself. However, the Duke of Cumberland was
so much misled by those wayward humours, that before
the end of the summer he sent Lord Albemarle<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a>
to Woburn, to sound their dispositions, and endeavour
to draw them from the Court. Not one, not his own
sister, Lady Tavistock, would talk to him on politics;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
only the Duchess said drily, that her husband was Minister,
and that everything was done that he desired.
Mr. Pitt had said more truly, some time before, “They
will disgust the Duke of Bedford in the spring, that
they may not be teazed with his solicitations; and
they will sweeten him again by winter, with some
trifling favour, that he may give them no trouble in
Parliament.”</p>

Luton itself, the building, or rather the enlargement of which he is
known to have personally superintended, with many faults had likewise
many beauties, and was surpassed in taste by few of the
mansions of that date, and certainly not by Strawberry Hill. He
had, in fact, a genuine love both of painting and architecture, and his
efforts to infuse the same into the mind of his royal pupil did not entirely
fail, for George the Third’s example was unquestionably a great

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> A Letter to the Honourable Brigadier General, Commander-in-Chief
of his Majesty’s Forces in Canada.—London, 1760.—It is
written with a point and spirit, and we may add, with a degree of malignity,
closely akin to Junius, to whose pen, indeed, it has recently
been ascribed. (See Preface by Mr. Simons to the new edition of this
Pamphlet.) A reply, under the title of “Refutation of a Letter,” &amp;c.,
composed, evidently, under the eye of Townshend or his family, appeared
shortly afterwards, and is equally intemperate, but very inferior
in ability. The controversy is so far prejudicial to Townshend, as
convicting him of an ungenerous indifference to the memory of the
great man who had led him to victory—his only excuse for the slight
manner in which he notices Wolfe in the despatch being, not “want
of esteem, but because of the impropriety of writing a panegyric to a
Minister, when nothing but the situation and exigence of affairs is
mentioned.” Townshend virtually admitted the justice of the charge,
by subsequently publishing a studied panegyric on Wolfe in the form
of a private letter, though it is more in the style of his brother’s parliamentary
speeches, and was probably the composition of the latter.
With respect to his opposition to Wolfe’s plan of attack, he stands
entirely acquitted. The Protest made by him, in common with other
officers, had been against a plan of attack which, in consequence of that
Protest, was abandoned, and the dissentients on that occasion were
those who proposed the very attack which proved so successful. The
two generals were certainly not suited to each other. Townshend,
though brave, clever, and not devoid of good feeling, was impatient of
authority, and possessed in a singular degree the faculty of detecting
and exaggerating the faults of his superiors. He had thus drawn upon
himself the resentment of the Duke of Cumberland, to whom he was
under great obligations, and had fallen into difficulties, out of which it
required the all-powerful patronage of Pitt to extricate him. A partial
friend (Mr. Glover) describes him as “often led into hasty and striking
judgments of men either in approbation or censure.” Wolfe was not
of a temperament to brook sarcasm, or even opposition, from a subordinate
officer; and yet he had peculiarities which Townshend could
scarcely overlook. One was a confidence in himself, which, as he took
no pains to disguise it, led superficial observers to question the reality
of his merit. Just before he quitted England for the last time, he
called to take leave of Lord Temple, whom he found sitting with a
colleague. The conversation turned on the prospects of the expedition;
and some stress being laid on the resistance that might be expected
from the numbers and gallantry of the French, Wolfe rose from his
chair, and drawing his sword, exclaimed with a loud voice, and in a
menacing attitude, that there was nothing to fear; for if he could
only come within reach of the enemy, his success was not a matter
of doubt, but of certainty. When he left the room the two Ministers
looked at each other with astonishment, and agreed, that to entrust
so hazardous an expedition to such a braggart, was indeed a fearful experiment.
The feeling that at all times appeared uppermost in his
mind, was an insatiable appetite for glory, and desire after posthumous
fame. He idolized genius either in arts or arms. Even on the day of
the attack, while sailing down the St. Lawrence, he read aloud Gray’s
Elegy, and observed several times to the officers with him, that he did
not know whether he would not rather be the author of that poem
than the conqueror of Quebec. In truth his was a noble nature. His
feelings were as genuine as they were ardent. He gave the most minute
attention to the welfare and comfort of his troops; and instead
of maintaining the reserve and stateliness so common with other commanders
of that day, his manner was frank and open, and he had a
personal knowledge of perhaps every officer in his army. We recollect
a respectable veteran, who, after having served under him at
Louisburgh and Cape Breton, commanded one of the first detachments
that scaled the heights of Abraham. In that exploit Captain ——
was shot through the lungs. On recovering his senses he saw Wolfe
standing by his side. Amidst the anxieties of such a critical hour, the
General stopped to press the hand of the wounded man—praised his services,
encouraged him not to abandon the hope of life—assured him of
leave of absence and early promotion; nay more, he desired an aide-de-camp
to give a message to that effect to General Monckton, should he
himself fall in the action; and, to the credit of General Monckton, the
promise was kept. No wonder that these qualities coupled with brilliant
success won the hearts of the soldiery: a sort of romance still clings
to his name. He is the only British General belonging to the reign of
George the Second who can be said to have earned a lasting reputation.
Long as this note is, it would be incomplete without some notice of
General Townshend. That officer was the son of Charles third Viscount
Townshend, and the witty Ethelreda Harrison, and therefore
the grandson of Charles second Viscount Townshend, the celebrated
colleague of Sir Robert Walpole. He was not loved by either of his
parents. His father, a man of dissolute habits, and an unnatural
parent, made for him so mean a provision, that on leaving the University
he joined the army abroad as a volunteer, and he served in that
capacity at the battle of Dettingen. He was afterwards reduced to
seek employment in the Dutch service, but, fortunately, was disappointed,
as about this time he attracted the notice of the Duke of
Cumberland, through whose interest he rose rapidly to the rank of
Colonel. He attended the Duke during the remainder of the war, and
distinguished himself at Fontenoy and Culloden. Subsequently, his
marriage with Lady de Ferrars, the heiress of the Northamptons,
placed him at once in opulent circumstances, and he was elected a
representative for Norfolk without opposition, except from his father.
The figure he made in the House, where he acquired considerable
influence, especially over members in the agricultural interest, has
caused him to be often noticed (generally with censure) in these Memoirs;
but though Walpole paints him in no pleasing colours, on the
other hand, another contemporary writer says that he was manly in
person, demeanour, and sentiment, and exemplary as a husband and
father, and, from his wit, agreeable to his friends and formidable to
those he disliked. It cannot be denied, however, that he was too
prone to mischief, and more worldly than seemed consistent with his
love of pleasure and ease. His life was singularly prosperous, and
prolonged to extreme old age. He became Viscount Townshend by
the death of his father in 1764. In 1767 he was appointed Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland; in 1787 he was created a Marquis, and in
1807, he died, aged 84, being then a Field Marshal, Governor of
Jersey, and Colonel of a regiment of Dragoons. Memoirs of George

made a very good speech or two at some of your public meetings in

The style is clear and persuasive, the tone calm, and the reasoning
close and logical. The examples from English history with
which the author supports his positions are skilfully chosen and agreeably
introduced, and his strictures on the King of Prussia have a smartness
and pungency that show no small command over the weapons of
controversy. Mr. Mauduit was agent for Massachusetts. He wrote
several tracts on the differences between England and her American
Colonies, as well as on subjects connected with the Dissenting interests,
of which he was a zealous and munificent promoter. He died unmarried,

statesman. Mr. Glover, in writing of him a few years before,
says, “George Grenville will, I believe, make the most useful

with Pitt.”—Mem. of a Distinguished Pol. and Lit. Character, p. 20.

His memory is embalmed in the brilliant panegyric of Mr. Burke
(speech on American Taxation); and a more sober, though not less
friendly estimate of his merits, has been since given by Mr. Knox.
(Cited in an interesting note to the Chatham Correspondence, vol. iii.
p. 486.) These prove how highly he was esteemed by his friends;
and it will be perceived in the course of this work that Walpole was
not always blind to his great knowledge of the Constitution, his capacity
for business, and his powers as a speaker in Parliament. The
unfavourable opinion, however, expressed of Mr. Grenville in the
text was by no means confined to Walpole, his unpopularity being
remarkable. Justice, indeed, was never shown to his abilities by the
public—even Dr. Johnson wrote of him, “Let him not be depreciated
in his grave. He had powers not universally possessed; could he
have enforced payment of the Manilla ransom, <em>he could have counted
it</em>.” (Cited in Boswell, vol. ii. p. 113.)—E.</p></div>

He cultivated literature, and was a very lively companion.
He spoke frequently in the House of Commons, and always
fluently and with spirit, but in a style better suited to the hustings
than to a deliberative assembly. His career was singular. He was the
second son of Sir John Erskine, Bart., of Alva, and succeeded to his title
on the death of his brother, Major Sir Charles Erskine, at Holst, just before
the battle of Lafeldt. He accompanied the expedition to L’Orient,
as Deputy Quarter-Master General of the Forces, under his uncle, General
St. Clair. Devoting himself afterwards to politics, he shared the
proscription which fell on the adherents of Leicester House, and was
dismissed the service. The new reign amply restored his fortunes.
With his commission he soon received the command of the Royal Scots;
and in four years he had already attained the rank of Lieutenant-General,
when he died, in 1765, in middle life. His marriage with Miss
Wedderburn, little as it promised at the time of worldly advantage,
brought wealth and rank into his family; the earldom and property
of her brother, Lord Chancellor Rosslyn, having devolved subsequently

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> Henry Bilson Legge, a younger son of the first Earl of Dartmouth,
was at this time Chancellor of the Exchequer. It should be remembered
that Mr. Legge had abandoned Lord Winchelsea, and attached himself
to Mr. Pelham in the Cabinet schism of 1744. He shared, with
many respectable statesmen of that day, the charge of having served
several masters, the partial changes so frequently made in the Government
having rendered coalitions almost inevitable, especially at a
time when, owing to the decline of Jacobitism, the lines of demarcation
between the different political parties had become very indistinct.
None, however, with whom he acted, could deny his eminent qualifications
as a man of business, or as a debater in the House of Commons
on all questions of trade and finance. His political integrity is less
commendable. Dodington says, that his thoughts were “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tout pour la
trippe</i>”—all for quarter-day (Diary, 407); and has, in common with
Walpole, reproached him with perfidy, in disclosing to the Duke of
Newcastle the negotiations of Leicester House with the Court in 1757.
The more detailed account of the transaction, since published in the
posthumous memoirs of Mr. Glover, makes it far more probable that
the secret was insidiously drawn from him by the Duke, whose skill
in imposing on men of superior ability to his own, is one of the most
remarkable traits of his character; and that Mr. Legge was very open
to such arts, may reasonably be inferred, from the well-known fact of
his having incurred the serious displeasure of George the Second by an
indiscreet slip in conversation, when minister at Berlin. He had the
laxity of principle that belonged to the school of Walpole, but there
is no ground for believing him to have been actually dishonest; and Mr.
Pelham, who knew him well, said, “that he thought him as good as his
neighbours: more able, and as willing, to serve them that served him
as anybody he had been acquainted with for some time.” Whatever
may have been his delinquencies in this respect, they would
certainly have been overlooked by the Court, had he added to them by
adopting the course which was urged on him by Lord Bute in the Hampshire
election. This is proved by their published correspondence, in
which he had a great advantage over Lord Bute. When that minister
had the assurance to ask him to support Sir Simeon Steuart, who had
come forward on the opposite interest, he honestly answered, “If the
Whigs and Dissenters, who are very numerous in this country, will
make it a point of opposing him, it will be impossible for me to
declare for him, and abandon those who have supported me, to take
part with those against whom they have supported me.” Lord Bute’s
rejoinder is admirable! he protests against any desire on the Prince’s
part to require the sacrifice of Mr. Legge’s honour, but besought
him out of real friendship, to consider seriously whether he could
not still, as far as was in his power, co-operate with the Prince’s
wishes for the return of two candidates, and required a categorical
answer. This was at once given in the negative by Mr. Legge,
who added, that he would submit to any consequences rather than
incur such a disgrace. Hence his dismissal. See more of Mr. Legge

Garter. Lord Winchelsea is one of the few statesmen of the reign of
George the Second whose character is worthy of a purer age. He was the
son of Lord Winchelsea, the great Tory leader, whose disgrace he shared
when that nobleman was dismissed for espousing the cause of the Jacobite
peers involved in the rebellion of 1715. He subsequently became
reconciled to Sir Robert Walpole, and in 1742 was appointed First
Lord of the Admiralty. Lord Waldegrave says of his conduct at that
period, “That it was so unexceptionable that faction itself was
obliged to be silent.”—Walpole Memoirs, p. 139. Horace Walpole is
equally warm in his praise. This is the testimony of political friends,
but it stands uncontradicted. Indeed Lord Winchelsea appears to
have enjoyed the respect of all parties. His public career, to use the
words of Lord Mahon, “without being illustrious, was long, useful,
and honourable.” He died in 1769, aged 81.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Robert Darcy, Earl of Holderness. This is an exaggeration of
Lord Holderness’s incapacity; for it appears by the Mitchell papers,
that he had attended closely to the business of his office, and performed
it respectably. His talents, however, were not above mediocrity.
His foreign connexions had recommended him to George the Second,
whom he attended as Lord of the Bedchamber at the battle of Dettingen,
and he was afterwards minister at Turin and at the Hague.
The Duke of Newcastle succeeded in making him Secretary of State,
against the opinion of Mr. Pelham, when scarcely thirty years of age.
His qualifications for that high office are thus summed up by the Duke,
in a letter, urging the appointment:—“He is indeed, or was thought,
trifling in his manner and carriage; but believe me, he has a solid understanding,
and will come out as prudent a young man as any in the
kingdom. He is good-natured, so that you may tell him his faults,
and he will mend them. He is very taciturn, dexterous enough, and
most punctual in the execution of his orders. He is got into the routine
of business, and knows well the present state of it.” (Letter from
Duke of Newcastle to Mr. Pelham, in Coxe’s Life of Pelham, vol. ii.
p. 387.) A portrait not less characteristic of the Duke than of Lord
Holderness. His lordship married a lady of the Fagel family, and his
mother was daughter of the last Duke of Schomberg. He died 1778,
without issue male, and his earldom became extinct. See more of
him in Walpole’s Memoirs, vol. i. p. 172; and Lord Waldegrave’s

of Lord Talbot to the Leicester House party certainly entitled him
to consideration, but he was now much overpaid; and this was felt
even by his patron Lord Bute, who wanted firmness to resist pretensions
which were urged with impetuosity, amounting almost to passion.—(Dodington’s
Diary, cited in note to the letter <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">supra</i>.) Lord

it requires some partiality to believe of his early youth that his

his taking an active part in public business, and in 1766 he
declined the embassy to Spain, which was pressed on him by Lord
Chatham. He died in 1790, aged 62, without having been married,

His Grace unquestionably possessed a powerful, active, and cultivated
mind. He had studied, and thoroughly understood the weaknesses
of men, and was unscrupulous in the practice of all the arts of
intrigue. Success usually crowned his efforts, and notwithstanding
the various changes of Government, he maintained much of his power
to the last. Disappointment attended only his private life, which was
chilled by aversion to his wife and the want of children. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Il fut

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_116" href="#FNanchor_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> The following note is transcribed from the manuscript memoirs of
Sir George Colebrooke, Bart., M.P., Chairman of the East India Company;
an eminent merchant, who sat many years in Parliament, and
possessed the confidence of some of the leading statesmen of his day.
</p>
<p>
“During the time I attended Newcastle House and the Treasury
Chambers on the Contract business, I had frequent opportunities of
knowing how despotically Mr. Pitt governed his ministerial colleagues,
and how much he was dreaded by the Duke. Some years afterwards
I recollect his Grace making this the subject of lively conversation at
table, at Claremont; but it was no subject of merriment at the time
the transaction passed. More than once I was summoned to the
Treasury to give an account of the state of the provisions, and of the
money, for the army, Mr. West giving, for reason, that Mr. Pitt
threatened the Duke, that if at any time a want of either should be
found, he would impeach him in the ensuing session. At the Treasury
I frequently met Mr. Wallis, Commissioner of the Navy, who
mentioned the following memorable instance. A train of artillery was
wanted at Portsmouth for an expedition. Mr. Pitt told Wallis that
it must be down by a certain day he named. Wallis made some
excuse for the delay, either that the transports were not ready or
the winds were contrary; upon which Mr. Pitt insisted that they
should go by land, a method of conveyance which was afterwards
pursued.
</p>
<p>
“General Harvey, who had been sent by Prince Ferdinand to prepare
matters in England for the campaign, and to carry over the English
draughts, waited on Mr. Pitt to take his leave. Mr. Pitt asked him
whether he had obtained everything he wanted, and the General answered,
not; and he therefore came to take leave, that no blame
might fall on him from the Prince. Mr. Pitt desired the General to
enumerate what he wanted, and immediately rang his bell for Mr.
Wood, who in the names of the different Boards signified to their
officers his Majesty’s commands for the dispatch of what was required
for Germany, and in four days General Harvey had in readiness
what he had been as many months soliciting.
</p>
<p>
“West, the Secretary, always looked frightened; and well he might,
for Mr. Pitt would have been as good as his word, which was to impeach
the Commissioners of the Treasury, if they neglected anything
needful for the war. At times he depended so little on them, that,
notwithstanding a contract to supply the army, he caused provisions
to be sent by victualling transports.
</p>
<p>
“Proceeding in the way I have mentioned, of writing in the names
of the different public officers, there were numberless hiatus in their
books of correspondence, and instances of orders carried into execution
without their sanction. The name of Lord Barrington was principally
used as Secretary at War, who did not know more than a
stranger of troops being ordered on service, till the embarkation had
actually taken place.
</p>
<p>
“The Duke of Newcastle, speaking himself of the cavalier manner
with which Mr. Pitt treated the Cabinet, mentioned the instance of
some foreign expedition which Mr. Pitt had proposed, but which, in
the opinion of the ministers, and of Lord Anson, First Lord of the
Admiralty, deprived Great Britain of too great a part of its internal
defence. Lord Mansfield had not yet given his opinion; but
Mr. Pitt, apprehensive that it would be against him, summed up the
opinions of Council, a majority of which he declared to be for the
expedition; adding, “The Chief Justice of England has no opinion
to give in this matter thereby stopping his mouth. The Duke told
Lord Coventry, that Mr. Murray, when Attorney-General, and in the
House of Commons, had acknowledged to him that he was intimidated
by Pitt. The more the latter found Murray to be intimidated,
the more he naturally pressed him.
</p>
<p>
“I never saw the Duke in higher spirits than after Mr. Pitt, thwarted
by the Cabinet in his proposal of declaring war against Spain, had
given notice of resignation. The Duke had done more wisely, if he
had followed Lord Hardwicke’s advice, and had resigned on the death
of his late master. The Duke could not endure to part with his
power, much less to devolve it on one who meant to keep it. When
he last resigned the Treasury to the Duke of Devonshire, it was with
a view to have it back again at a convenient season.”—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> The following extraordinary notice was published in the Gazette
of the 9th October: “The Right Honourable William Pitt having resigned
the Seals into the King’s hands, His Majesty was this day
pleased to appoint the Earl of Egremont to be one of His Majesty’s
principal Secretaries of State; and, in consideration of the great and
important services of the said Mr. Pitt, His Majesty has been graciously
pleased to direct that a warrant be prepared for granting to
the Lady Hesther Pitt, his wife, a Barony of Great Britain, by the
name, style, and title of Baroness of Chatham, to herself, and of
Baron of Chatham to her heirs male, and also to confer upon the
said William Pitt, Esq., an annuity of three thousand pounds sterling,
during his own life and that of Lady Hesther Pitt, and their
son John Pitt, Esq.”—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_118" href="#FNanchor_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> It certainly is not the practice now (1844) to insert pensions in
the Gazette. Whether it ever was so it would be difficult to ascertain,
as there is no index prior to the year 1787. The impression of
two very old officers, who have frequent occasions to consult the Gazette,
is, that no such general practice ever prevailed.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_119" href="#FNanchor_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> It was by such expressions as this that Mr. Pitt created the disappointment
in the public mind, that followed the announcement of
his pension. To use the words of Lord Brougham: “He did not
sustain the exalted pitch of magnanimous independence, and utter disregard
of sublunary interests, which we should expect him to have
reached and kept as a matter of course, from a mere cursory glance at
the mould in which his lofty character was cast.” Statesmen of the
Time of George III., 1st series, p. 45. A pension of £4000 a year to
Lord Holderness passed without a murmur, while one of £3000 a year
to Mr. Pitt raised a general burst of indignation, only because the
country regarded the latter as lowering their idol to the level of the
jobbing statesmen of the day. The cry against Mr. Pitt was, indeed,
almost universal. See letter to Mr. Conway, vol. iv. of Walpole’s Collected
Correspondence, p. 184; and particularly the note containing the
opposite opinions of Mr. Gray and Mr. Burke. Mr. Pitt’s noble
refusal of the vast emoluments of the Pay-office, which so enriched
those who preceded and succeeded him as Paymaster, entitles his conduct
in all pecuniary matters to a liberal construction from posterity.
What is really to be regretted, is the humiliating tone of his correspondence
with Lord Bute, in accepting the pension (Chatham Correspondence,
vol. ii. p. 152,) and his language at his interview with the King
on that occasion.—Annual Register for 1761. But we will not dwell
on the defects of a man who certainly was far above his age, not only
in talent, but in real independence.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_143" href="#FNanchor_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> Richard Glover, a merchant, who, by superior intelligence, great
fluency of speech in public, and some reputation as a poet, had gained
considerable influence in the City, and was thought of sufficient
importance to be admitted into the councils of Leicester House.
This distinction, and the success of his poems, which had all a political
tendency, made him fancy himself on an equality with Pitt,
Lyttelton, and the other men of talent who surrounded the Prince of
Wales. The illusion was painfully dispelled. The sudden death of
the Prince broke up the party; Mr. Glover’s services were no longer
required; and happening to be at the time under commercial embarrassments,
he sank into obscurity. In a few years, however, by
diligent application, and a successful speculation in the copper trade,
he retrieved his fortunes, but he never forgave the neglect of his former
associates; and the memoirs he left behind him show the angry feelings
he entertained, particularly against Mr. Pitt. To this circumstance
he probably owed his seat for Weymouth, the borough being
one of those which Mr. Dodington placed at the disposal of Lord Bute.
Mr. Glover died in 1785, aged 73. His autobiography from 1742
to 1757 was published in 1813, under the title of Memoirs of a Distinguished
Literary and Political Character. They are not without
spirit, but show few signs of a powerful mind, and are in every respect
inferior to what might have been expected from him.—E.</p></div>

persons of undoubted veracity, who are at this moment in no common
sphere of life.” History of the Minority, p. 30. Mr. Adolphus states
the treaty itself to have been communicated to Mr. Pitt by the Earl
Marechal Keith, in gratitude for the reversal of his attainder, but “that
the fact, if it existed, was not disclosed to the Cabinet,” Adolphus, vol. i.
p. 44. This story receives some confirmation from a cotemporary memoir
of the Earl Marechal recently published by the Spalding Society of Aberdeen,
and supposed to have been written by Sir Robert Strange, who had
once been a zealous Jacobite. Neither the Chatham Correspondence
nor the Mitchell manuscripts contain anything on the subject; and
the papers of the Earl Marechal, at Cumbernald, have never been
thoroughly examined. The Editor is disposed to believe the intelligence
received by Mr. Pitt did not go so far as the existence of the
treaty, but consisted of facts sufficient, in his estimation, to leave
no doubt of the object of the negotiation between France and Spain,
and of the general intentions of the Spanish government. These
facts he had imparted to Lord Bute, who had not drawn the same
conclusions from them. Hist. of Minority, p. 33.—E.</p></div>

very handsomely mentioned by Lord Rochford. Some of his private
letters in the Chatham Correspondence, as well as his public dispatches
in the Parliamentary Papers, are those of an ambassador who understood
his duty, and performed it. He laboured hard, in conjunction
with his friend the Marquis of Grimaldi, to restore the old connection
of his country with France; and one result of their success was, the
appointment of Grimaldi to succeed Wall as First Minister of Spain.
Fuentes, then, for some time, replaced Grimaldi at Paris; and subsequently
returning to Spain, he employed all his influence, which was
considerable, in supporting Grimaldi’s administration, until the latter
imprudently allowed his son, the Prince of Pignatelli, to accompany
the expedition to Algiers, under the Count O’Reily, in 1777, where
the Prince perished; and Fuentes, who had refused his consent to
his going, was so deeply offended, that he immediately joined the opposition

not less than his fault, that they were seldom well directed. His
brilliant defence of Cassel during the Seven years’ war showed that he
had no mean capacity for war; but his ambition was, to shine as a
statesman, and, unhappily for him, the enmity of Choiseul excluded him
from civil employments. Partly, perhaps, out of revenge, and partly
from his love of political intrigue, he condescended to take charge of
the secret correspondence which Louis the Fifteenth carried on for
many years, independently of his ministers, at the principal foreign
Courts, a system which made it almost impossible for an honourable
man to serve the King with benefit. M. de Broglio eventually fell
into disgrace, and died in obscurity in 1781, aged 62.—E.</p></div>

good speeches, and only two, in the English House of Commons.
One being forgotten (the last being of inferior merit to the other),
he was long known by the name of <em>Single-speech</em>. He came into
Parliament in 1754; and after sitting silent for somewhat more
than a year, at length delivered that <em>single speech</em> upon which his
reputation has exclusively rested down to the present day. This
speech, which we are told was set and full of antitheses, was in
favour of the Ministry, and was speedily rewarded by a place at
the Board of Trade.—Edinburgh Review, vol. xv. p. 164. He
had a promptitude of thought, and a rapid flow of well-conceived
matter, with many other requisites that only seemed waiting for
opportunities to establish his reputation as an orator. These were
set off by a striking countenance, a graceful carriage, great self-possession,
and personal courage.—Cumberland’s Memoirs, i. 225.
With all these advantages he did not rise to eminence, nor did he
deserve it, for his views were narrow, and he was selfish and cold-hearted.
He resumed his silence upon attaining the lucrative and
sinecure office of Chancellor of the Exchequer in Ireland, and died
in 1796, rich and unmarried. His “Parliamentary Logic” is an

commander. The Prince had in 1752 been worsted at Breslau,
where he had only twenty-four thousand men to oppose to an army
of ninety thousand, under Daun and Prince Charles of Lorraine. In

had not been employed on active service for a very long period, the
Government surely acted discreetly in not appointing him to this command.
He died in 1773, in his 83rd year. His life had been singularly
licentious, even for the Courts of Russia and Portugal, where,
however, he acquired extraordinary influence, for he had a thorough
knowledge of the world, a great deal of humour, and an undaunted
spirit. See more of him in Walpole’s Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 291; and

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_188" href="#FNanchor_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> This remarkable man was Sovereign of Lippe Buckebourgh, a
petty state, lying on the confines of Hanover and Westphalia. His
mother was daughter of George the First, by the Duchess of Kendal.
He received the early part of his education in England, and held a
commission in the Guards: at nineteen, he served at the battle of
Dettingen; and two years after he showed signal intrepidity as a
volunteer under Prince Lobkowitz, in Italy. At the outset of the
Seven years’ war he joined the Confederates with his small contingent,
and bore a prominent part in the various military operations that ensued.
His bravery, in common with his opinions, had a tinge of
eccentricity, but the boldness and originality of his mind were not ill
directed. He became an enterprising and successful partisan, and an able
commander of artillery; in which latter capacity he distinguished himself
both at Minden and at Kampen. Being intrusted with a separate
corps for the reduction of Munster, he not only captured the place, but
defeated General Armentières, who had been sent with a French army
to its relief. It was in Portugal, however, that he established his reputation.
“He found the army there,” says his biographer, “in a
state of thorough disorganization, without either food or pay; even
the guards at the Royal Palace implored alms from strangers, with
bended knees and outstretched caps. The officers, impelled by want,
followed various humble crafts. There were instances of the husband
working as a journeyman tailor, whilst his wife earned her subsistence
as a washerwoman; and captains might be seen bringing baskets of
linen from the wash. Many were servants in the households of generals
and governors; indeed servants were sometimes presented with
commissions in order that their pay might serve in lieu of wages.”
All these abuses the Count, unsupported, if not opposed by the Court
and the ministers, succeeded in rectifying. With the assistance of the
English, he checked the progress of the Spanish troops, and defeated
them in several encounters. He built the citadel of Elvas. He organized
a plan for the defence of the kingdom; and at the end of the war
he quitted Portugal, followed by the gratitude and attachment of the
King and the people. Indeed, the House of Braganza were not under
greater obligations to his illustrious predecessor, Marshal Schomberg.
His reforms show considerable acuteness and knowledge of character,
and were completely successful. One of the most questionable was,
that while he punished officers in Germany for accepting a challenge,
he punished the Portuguese for refusing, with the view of restoring
a martial spirit among the troops. The remainder of his life he passed
at Buckebourgh, the chief town of La Lippe, beloved by his subjects,
and always employed in promoting their prosperity, though he has
been charged with sometimes mistaking himself for a great monarch,
while he was only a petty prince. He married in 1765 the Countess
of La Lippe Bustafeld, a young lady of great beauty and accomplishments,
and had one daughter, whose early death was quickly followed
by that of the mother; and the Count, inconsolable under this double
affliction, fell into a lingering disorder, of which he died in 1777,
at the age of 53. He enjoyed the warm friendship of the King of
Prussia, the Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, and other great commanders.
They entertained a high opinion of his military capacity.
He inspired a sort of enthusiasm in all around him. Even the
Spanish officers, who used to ridicule his reforms, and when they first
descried him in the field, with his large hat and little sword, contemptuously
asked whether the Portuguese were commanded by Don
Quixote, eventually partook of the general feeling of admiration that
attached to his generosity—his extreme disinterestedness—his abilities
and valour. Biographische Denkmale, von K. Barnhagen von

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> Though so notorious at the time, we have been able to find
only one pamphlet on the subject in the British Museum, and the
papers seem to have been very reluctant to give the names of the
parties. July 10, 1762, William Parsons, Elizabeth his wife, Mary
Fraser, the Ghost’s interpreter, a clergyman, and a respectable
tradesman, were tried at Guildhall, and convicted of a conspiracy
to defame a Mr. Kent. In the Annual Register it is said, “The Court
chusing that Mr. Kent, who had been so much injured on the occasion,
should receive some reparation by punishment of the offenders, deferred
giving judgment for seven or eight months, <em>in hopes that the parties
might make it up in the meantime</em>. Accordingly, the clergyman and
tradesman agreed to pay Mr. Kent a round sum—some say between
500<i>l.</i> and 600<i>l.</i>—to purchase their pardon, and were, therefore, dismissed
with a severe reprimand. The father was ordered to be set in the
pillory three times in one month—once at the end of Cock Lane;
Elizabeth his wife to be imprisoned one year; and Mary Fraser six
months in Bridewell, with hard labour. The father appearing to be
out of his mind at the time he was first to stand in the pillory, the
execution of that part of his sentence was deferred to another day,
when, as well as the other day of his standing there, the populace took
so much compassion on him, that instead of using him ill, they made
a handsome subscription for him.”—<i>v.</i> Annual Register, vol. cxlii. and
Gentleman’s Magazine, 1762, pp. 43 and 339. The liberty to speak to
the prosecutor, described above as sanctioned by Lord Mansfield, would
not now be so openly permitted, even by a bench of Middlesex Magistrates.
Churchill’s poem mentions “the Ghost,” only as a peg to
hang a satire upon. It has much vigour, but a key is wanted, and
probably nobody can supply one to the allusions, or even the regularly
drawn characters of the greater part: Johnson, Warburton, Mansfield,
and one or two more are apparent. “The Ghost” has also furnished
the very clever scene of the trial of Fanny the Phantom, in Foote’s
farce of “The Orators.”—E.</p></div>

had been Minister at Turin from 1758 to 1762, when he was appointed
to Venice; but, before he could leave Turin, the death of the
Duke of Argyle caused Lord Bute to bring him home abruptly to take
the direction of the Government in Scotland; an exercise of the
Favourite’s power, which proved him to be virtually at the head of
the Administration. From the same feelings of exclusiveness, Lord
Bute subsequently selected Mr. Mackenzie, in preference to any of his
colleagues in the Cabinet, to assist him in the early part of the
negotiations for peace. Whatever points were settled by his Lordship
with the King, were then communicated, through Mr. Mackenzie,
to the Count de Virri, by whom they were transmitted, through
the Bailli de Solar, to the Duke of Choiseul, and it was only after
an article had been actually agreed upon that it came officially
under the cognizance of the Foreign Department; so that these
two foreigners appear to have possessed more of Lord Bute’s confidence,
as well as more influence over the negotiation, than the
Secretary of State, Lord Egremont; a circumstance which rather
explains the jealousy shown by the Cabinet, when the preliminaries
had been settled, of any independent authority being given
to the Duke of Bedford. These duties Mr. Mackenzie discharged
irreproachably, and, far from sharing his brother’s unpopularity,
was much esteemed by all parties. He is described by his secretary,
M. Dutens, as having been most amiable, remarkably cheerful
and pleasant in society, with very simple tastes, and no ambition;
“well versed in the sciences, particularly in mathematics, algebra,
and astronomy.” He took little part in public affairs after Lord

fine field for the wits of the day, and was of course greatly exaggerated.
One of them describes him as “a man to whom a sum of five
figures was an impenetrable secret.” His vocation, certainly, was not
to the Exchequer; and he was unfortunate in having Mr. Legge for
his predecessor. There were other high offices of the Government
which he would have filled with credit, for he had respectable talents,
was “spirited, frank, and manly,” and had gained the consideration of
the House. (Smollet.) He was the only son of Sir Francis Dashwood,
Baronet, M.P. for Winchelsea, by Lady Mary Fane, sister of the
Earl of Westmoreland, often mentioned in these Memoirs. In his
youth he had travelled much, especially in Italy, and passed some
time at Rome, where he was long recollected from the following
anecdote, which made a great noise at the time. “It was on
Good Friday, when each person who attends the service in the
Sistine Chapel, as he enters, takes a small scourge from an attendant
at the door. The chapel is dimly lighted, and there are
three candles which are extinguished by the priest, one by one: at
the putting out of the first, the penitents take off one part of their
dress; at the next still more; and, in the darkness which follows the
extinguishing of the third candle, lay on their own shoulders, with
groans and lamentations. Sir Francis Dashwood, thinking this mere
stage effect, entered with others, dressed in a large watchman’s coat;
demurely took his scourge from the priest, and advanced to the end of
the chapel; where, on the darkness ensuing, he drew from beneath his
coat an English horsewhip and flogged right and left quite down the
chapel and made his escape, the congregation exclaiming ‘Il diavolo! il
diavolo!’ and thinking the Evil one was upon them with a vengeance!
The consequence of this frolic might have been serious to him, had he
not immediately fled the Papal dominions.”—(Private Information.)
His political life was by no means discreditable; and, in the unfortunate
affair of Admiral Byng, he exhibited kindness of feeling not
less than tact and decision, which Walpole has elsewhere handsomely
noticed.—Memoirs, ii. p. 145. He had a taste for the arts, and
brought sculptors and painters from Italy to decorate his country-seat
at West Wycombe, in Buckinghamshire, where he laid out an extensive
park with skill and effect, and built a church and mausoleum.
His private life was reported to be very licentious. He married the
widow of Sir Richard Ellys, Baronet, by whom he had no children,
and died in 1781. The peerage, to which his claim is mentioned in a
following page, descended to the Stapylton family.—E.</p></div>

talents and accomplishments, a taste for abstract disquisitions which
rarely occurs in men of the world, accompanied with that soundness

for slandering Admiral Knowles. [His “genius,” however, to use
the words of Walter Scott, “has raised an imperishable monument
to his memory,” in the poems and novels which Walpole does not
deign to notice in this allusion to his works. Nor is the criticism just
in other respects. Smollet’s tracts are not more virulent than most
publications of a similar character of that day. His censure of the
Duke of Cumberland has been confirmed by subsequent historians,
and his punishment for the libel on Admiral Knowles reflects discredit
on the Admiral rather than on himself.—See Walter Scott’s Lives

Smollet and Murphy, with Dr. Shebbeare, who was in Newgate for
abusing King George the First, King George the Second, King William,

who even in a Dictionary had vented his Jacobite principles, were
selected by Lord Bute to defend his cause, and pensioned by him
as a patron of learned men. Johnson’s acceptance of a pension
was the more ridiculous, as in his Dictionary he had lashed the
infamy of pensioners. [Neither Smollet nor Murphy were pensioned
by Lord Bute. The bounty of the Crown was never more inexcusably
exercised than in favour of Dr. Shebbeare—a pamphleteer
who was a disgrace to his party, and had not long before
been concerned in some fraudulent practices at Oxford, when employed
by the University to arrange the Clarendon papers. He died
in 1788, at a very advanced age. Dr. Johnson’s pension was not

His murder certainly had her ready forgiveness, if not her acquiescence,

recently published Memoirs of the Princess Dashkau is very far from

who brought proposals that did not suit the views of the King of

popularity is noticed by Lord Chesterfield. He was a generous,

respectable writer for one who made literature only an amusement.
His private life was exemplary; and he showed no common strength

It is not improbable that a generous Prince might resent the indignity
offered to his country. He might, too, resent the unrelenting hatred
of the Princess, and his total exclusion from power. He might feel
for Germany, his other country, which he saw neglected: or he
might have hoped that the aversion of the Princess to the House of
Brunswick would not cease without disgusting Prince Ferdinand;
and that then, if the war had continued, the command would have
once more devolved on himself.</p></div>

facts that I have been able to collect on the subject, in the quarters
likely to be the best informed, are these:—On the 7th of September
Lord Egremont wrote to the Duke of Bedford, informing him of the
King’s commands that he should not sign the preliminaries without
first sending them over for his Majesty’s approbation. On the 18th
the Duke wrote to M. de Choiseul that he was ready to sign, and
that he only <em>waits his answer to send his messenger to London</em>.
On the 28th or 29th Lord Egremont wrote by the French courier
of M. de Nivernois that the Havannah was taken. On the 30th he
repeats the news, and promises fresh instructions. The Duke never
pretended to sign against the King’s orders, though he complained of
their tenor. Thus Walpole’s story becomes very improbable.—E.</p></div>

Lord Marichal was afterwards in the service of the King of Prussia,

really loved. He was a philosopher after the fashion of that monarch,
but a more practical and amiable one; for he bore the loss of rank and
wealth, and the various discomforts of a long and almost hopeless
exile, with unostentatious cheerfulness, conducting himself all the
while so prudently, that amidst his many political opponents he
had not a single personal enemy. The general esteem that followed
him through life afterwards attached to his memory; and his name
is rarely to be found mentioned in the works of his contemporaries
without some expressions showing an earnest desire to represent him
in the fairest colours. D’Alembert wrote an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éloge</i> in his honour.
His brother, Marshal Keith, was a man of far superior ability, and his
exile was a serious loss to the British army. Lord Marichal died

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_261" href="#FNanchor_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> “This honest old General,” as he is called by Lord Chesterfield,
owed his high rank entirely to his own merit, being a French Huguenot,
of not distinguished parentage, and without connections in this country.
He was a very brave, zealous, and intelligent officer. He had served
with Marlborough in the German wars, and his conduct afterwards at
Dettingen attracted the particular notice of George the Second, who invested
him with the insignia of the Bath on the field, in front of the
whole army. As an additional mark of the King’s favour, he was
also raised to a high command in Flanders, from which time all the
skill shown in the Duke of Cumberland’s military operations,—which
at Fontenoy was not inconsiderable, for the battle was only
lost by the misconduct of General Ingoldsby,—the army ascribed
exclusively to him, his Royal Highness being believed to act in a
great measure under his guidance: and, indeed, he was usually called
the Duke’s military tutor. In the Duke’s absence during the Scotch
rebellion of 1745, he succeeded to the command of the British troops
in Flanders, and was present with ten battalions in the unfortunate
battle of Raucoux, where he almost retrieved the errors of Prince
Charles of Lorraine, and is admitted to have saved the army from
total destruction. The brilliant charges of cavalry by which he
protected the retreat of the allies have obtained the praise even
of the French historians. (Coxe’s Pelham, vol. i. p. 322; Lacratelle,
vol. ii. p. 350.) The Duke returned in the following year, as
if only to lose the battle of Lafeldt; on which occasion Sir John
Ligonier reaped the same melancholy glory that had attended him
at Raucoux. At seventy years of age, he led a charge of cavalry
that broke the enemy’s line, and had he not been taken prisoner,
might have turned the fortune of the day. Louis the Fifteenth received
him with distinction; and, though a rebellious subject, made
him the bearer of the overtures of the peace, which, on the following
year, was concluded at Aix-la-Chapelle. The remainder of his life
was passed in less active service, and in the enjoyment of the rank
and honours he had so well earned. In 1757 he was made Commander-in-chief;
in 1759, Field-Marshal; in 1766, after passing
through the subordinate steps in the peerage, he was created Earl
Ligonier. He retained to the last the gaiety and amiability which
had made him the favourite both of the army and the Court. His
tastes were simple; one of his chief amusements being the embellishment
of his country-seat in Surrey, of which his gardens were
the admiration of the neighbourhood. He died in 1770, aged 92;
and was succeeded in his title by his nephew, an estimable and
popular nobleman, who had been Aide-de-camp to Prince Ferdinand
at the battle of Minden, and on whose death, without issue, the title
became extinct.—E.</p></div>

by Lord Chesterfield, to which they are both indebted, is so full of life
and spirit, that the editor cannot refrain from inserting it.
</p>
<p>
“He had great parts and a most uncommon share of learning for
a man of quality. He was one of the best speakers in the House
of Lords, both in the declamatory and the argumentative way. He
had a wonderful quickness and precision in seizing the stress of a
question, which no art, no sophistry, could disguise in him. In
business he was bold, enterprising, and overbearing. He had been
bred up in high monarchical, that is, tyrannical principles of government,
which his ardent and imperious temper made him think were
the only rational and practical ones. He would have been a great
first Minister in France, little inferior, perhaps, to Richelieu; in this
government, which is yet free, he was neither ill-natured nor vindictive,
and had a great contempt for money—his ideas were all above it.
In social life he was an agreeable, good-humoured, and instructive
companion, a great but interesting talker.
</p>
<p>
“He degraded himself by the vice of drinking, which, together with
a great stock of Greek and Latin, he had brought from Oxford, and
practised ever afterwards. By his own industry he had made himself
master of all the modern languages, and had acquired great knowledge
of the law. His political knowledge of the interests of princes
and of commerce was extensive, and his notions were just and great.
His character may be summed up in nice precision, great decision,
and overbearing presumption.”—Chesterfield’s Miscell. Works, vol. iv.
p. 49.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_290" href="#FNanchor_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> I shall give two instances of my assertions. Sir William Milner
held a place of about 2000<i>l.</i> a year in the Custom-house, the greater
portion of which had been allotted to his wife’s aunt, Mrs. Poyntz,<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">a</a>
as a jointure on the death of her husband, who had been governor to
the Duke of Cumberland. This was now taken away, and bestowed
by Lord Bute on Mr. Poole, to make him amends for the ravage
made on his family<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">b</a> in this new persecution; Lord Bute intending at
the same time to reserve 600<i>l.</i> a year out of it for Mrs. Poyntz.
Lord Spencer, who had married her daughter, wrote to the King
representing the case, and begging his protection for Mrs. Poyntz.
The petition concluded with telling the King that this application
was made to <em>him</em>, because probably his Majesty would hear of the
grievance no other way. On this the whole was stopped; but that Fox
might bear all the odium, and Lord Bute have all the merit, the latter
sent a message by Lord Ancram to the Duke of Cumberland,<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">c</a> to say,
that if his Royal Highness would take it as a favour, the King would
continue the pension to Mrs. Poyntz; and it was accepted.
</p>
<p>
The other was the case of Mrs. Cavendish, widow of an Admiral of
that name. She had for many years enjoyed a housekeeper’s place in
one of the offices, in lieu of a pension as an Admiral’s widow. Fox,
hunting after employments for his dependents and objects of vengeance
for himself, lighting on the name of a Cavendish, took away her
place. The lady, of a respectable family, and sister of Mrs. Cartwright,
Maid of Honour to the late Queen, sent the latter to Lady
Suffolk,<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">d</a> from whom I heard this account, immediately to entreat by
her means an audience of Lady Elizabeth Mackenzie.<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">e</a> Mrs. Cavendish
herself, living in devotion and unknown <em>to</em>, proved to be a
relation <em>of</em> Lady Bute; to whom Lady E. Mackenzie had instantly
applied. Lady Bute, no less surprised, sent for her lord up stairs.
He said the story could not be true: it was one Mrs. Greening that
was displaced, to make room for Mrs. Goldsworthy, a companion of
the late Duchess of Richmond.<a id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">f</a> It proved that Fox had thus imposed
on Lord Bute, to whom the name of Mrs. Cavendish had never been
mentioned, and who gave her immediate redress.</p></div>

Though Norton had the character at the bar of being the reverse of
a liberal practitioner, it is very improbable that Walpole’s assertion,
“that he took money from both parties” in a suit, should be literally
correct. He had too many rivals as well as enemies in the profession,
to admit of such conduct remaining unpunished; but it is not uncommon
for a counsel to feel himself bound <em>in honour</em> to refuse a brief
which he could not accept without using knowledge acquired while
employed by parties who had a different interest, until he has given
those parties the option of employing him again; and Norton’s
eagerness for gain made him take a very narrow view of such

which Walpole notices in his Memoirs of George the Second
without censure. It was to his refusal of that offer, and to his subsequent
connection with Mr. Grenville, that Lord Egremont owed this
severe imputation. He was proud, obstinate, and hot-tempered; but
that he was not without talent is proved by his answer to the Spanish
memorial, a State paper of acknowledged merit. Bishop Newton,
who knew him well, says, “that if he had entered earlier into business,
he might have made as considerable a figure as his father had. He
had seldom occasion to speak in Parliament, but, when he did, it was
with great clearness, force, and energy; and he was thought to resemble

many years. He describes him thus: “I am persuaded he was
formed to be a good man, he might also have been a great one: his
mind was large, his spirit active, his ambition honourable; he had a
carriage noble and imposing; his first approach attracted notice; his
consequent address ensured respect. If his talents were not quite so
solid as some, nor altogether so deep as others, yet they were brilliant,
popular, and made to glitter in the eyes of men: splendour was his
passion; his good-fortune threw opportunities in his way to have
supported it; his ill-fortune blasted all those energies which should
have been reserved for the crisis of his public fame. The first offices
of the State, the highest honours which his Sovereign could bestow,
were showered upon him when the spring of his mind was broken;
and his genius, like a vessel overloaded with treasure, but far gone in
decay, was only precipitated to ruin by the very freight that, in its
better days, would have crowned it with prosperity and riches.” Vol.
i. p. 242. This is a generous portrait, considering that Cumberland
had certainly been unkindly treated by Lord Halifax; and, had he
always felt thus, he would not have furnished Sheridan with the
model of Sir Fretful Plagiary.—E.</p></div>

week has given the public the most abandoned instance of official
effrontery ever attempted to be imposed on mankind. The minister’s
speech last Tuesday is not to be paralleled in the annals of this country.
I am in doubt whether the imposition is greater on the Sovereign
or on the nation. Every friend of his country must lament that a
Prince of so many great and amiable qualities, whom England truly
reveres, can be brought to give the sanction of his name to the most
odious measures, and to the most unjustifiable public doctrines, from a
Throne ever renowned for truth, honour, and unsullied virtue. I am sure
all foreigners, especially the King of Prussia, will hold the minister in
contempt and abhorrence. He has made our Sovereign declare, ‘<em>My
expectations have been fully answered by the happy effects which the
several allies of my crown have derived from the salutary measure of
the definitive treaty. The powers at war with my good brother the
King of Prussia have been induced to agree to such terms of accommodation
as that great Prince has approved, and the success which has
attended my negotiation has necessarily and immediately diffused the
blessings of peace throughout Europe.</em>’ The infamous fallacy of this
whole sentence is apparent to all mankind; for it is known that the
King of Prussia did not barely approve, but absolutely dictated as conqueror,
every article of the terms of peace. No advantage of any kind
has accrued to that magnanimous Prince from our negotiation; but
he was basely deserted by the Scottish Prime Minister of England.
He was known by every Court in Europe to be scarcely on better
terms here than at Vienna, and he was betrayed by us in the treaty
of peace. What a strain of insolence, therefore, is it in a minister to
lay claim to what he is conscious his efforts tended to prevent, and
meanly to arrogate to himself a share in the fame and glory of one of
the greatest Princes the world has ever seen!”—E.</p></div>

[He had been Minister at Berlin in the reign of George the Second, and
received various honours from Frederick the Great, whose preference
of him to such men as Mr. Legge and Mr. Fox, and even to Sir
Andrew Mitchell, probably arose from the same reasons that induced
Napoleon to bestow the warmest praise on such of his enemy’s generals
as he most wished to have as opponents. Lord Hyde was an
amiable nobleman, of very comely person, and graceful deportment;
he married one of the coheiresses of Lord Clarendon, was elevated to

letter, and the letters in the Chatham Correspondence (vol. ii.

Pitt hardly belong to his character, and certainly were not exhibited
on this occasion. His private correspondence proves, as he told the
King, that he felt throughout the impossibility of his making a ministry,
unless it rested “on the great families who had supported the Revolution
Government, and other great persons, of whose ability and integrity
the country had had experience, and who had weight and

ended with the failure of the expedition to Algiers. His chief merit

in 1780, and for some years after resided at Brunswick, where the
Princess, who was throughout life deservedly esteemed, made his
Court very agreeable. In 1787 he commanded the Prussian forces
which took possession of Amsterdam, and put down the republican
party in Holland. His campaigns against the French republicans
were less successful, and his well-known manifesto rendered his failure
more glaring. He was mortally wounded at Auerstadt, and expired
at Altona on the 10th of November, 1806, leaving behind him the
reputation of a bold and enterprising, rather than of an able general.
His Duchess took refuge in England, where she died at an advanced
age. They were not happy in their family: of their two daughters,
the eldest married the late King of Wirtemberg, and came to a
miserable end in Russia; the younger was the unfortunate Queen

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_420" href="#FNanchor_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> This character of Sir George Saville is not less honourable to his
memory than Mr. Burke’s well-known and brilliant panegyric at the
Bristol election in 1780. Few public men received more respect
from their cotemporaries—few, perhaps, have so well earned it. He
devoted his time, his talents, and his purse almost exclusively to the
public service. Neither the fashionable nor literary circles of London,
nor the pursuits of the country, had any charm for him; he seldom
resided at Rufford, the splendid seat of his ancestors: business was
his passion, and whether in town or country, constituted his sole occupation;
fortunately, he had abilities to perform it creditably, and
his generosity, which was scarcely bounded by his great estate, had
always usefulness for its object. The same discernment appears in
his selection of the Parliamentary questions with which his name is
identified, such as the Limitation of the Claims of the Crown on
Landed Estates; the Relief of Roman Catholics as well as of Protestant
Dissenters, and the Condemnation of General Warrants, and,
lastly, the Improved Representation of the People: all these he advocated
with an earnestness and singleness of purpose, and consistency
of action, which extorted the admiration even of his opponents.
Though not an impressive speaker, he was always sensible and
very fluent, and he spared no pains to understand his subject. His
speeches, indeed, partook of one of the characteristics of his mind,
which was a simplicity approaching to austerity, and an exemption
from party, or even popular prejudices. His life in all respects strictly
corresponded with his principles, and was unstained by vice or even
by weakness of any kind; his death was regarded as a public loss. He
died in 1784, unmarried, aged 57, and with him ended the last line
of the illustrious family of Saville. He was a collateral descendant of
the Marquis of Halifax, to whose estates his father had succeeded.—E.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_421" href="#FNanchor_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> This house, in which James Earl Waldegrave died, has again become
remarkable by a club created there in 1769 by several ladies of
first rank; the first public female club ever known, and which gave
great offence, though the ladies were almost all of distinguished virtue.
Nor, though the age was notorious for divorces, though most of the female
members were of the greatest beauty, and though most of the young
men of fashion were of the club, did any scandal happen from that society.
Even gaming, which at that time raged to so enormous a degree,
went to no great lengths there. So that vice and satire, which
prevailed so exceedingly, did not always meet where they deserved
to meet. The King and Queen marked their disapprobation of the
club, while Lord Despenser, Lord Talbot, and Lord Pembroke were
in place, while Lady Berkeley was of the bedchamber to the Princess
Dowager, though her husband, Lord Clare, had disavowed her last
child, and while Miss Chudleigh had remained Maid of Honour to her,
though she had owned her marriage with Captain Hervey to her Royal
Highness, till she openly married the Duke of Kingston, though Hervey
was alive; and was received by all the Royal Family as Duchess,
after having been publicly kept by the Duke as his mistress. No
wonder the sanctity of the Court passed for hypocrisy.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_442" href="#FNanchor_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> This statement is probably much exaggerated. There is no
doubt that Pratt applied to the Court, according to the usual practice,
to appoint a day for Hensey’s execution. Lord Mansfield desired
him to name the day, and on Hensey’s solicitor asking that it might
not be an early day, Pratt said he was ready to give as long a day
as might be proper. At last the Court agreed that it might be a
month.—Burr. Reports, vol. i. p. 651, R. v. Hensey. The sentimentality
imputed to Pratt certainly formed no part of his character;
and as the story is without question inaccurate, we may
fairly doubt whether Norton was guilty of so curious a piece of
brutality. Hensey was respited on the very morning that he
was going to execution. On the 5th of Sept. 1759, he appeared

blind his judgment and disfigure his narrative.”—Mem. vol. i. p. 139,
note. He certainly has in this instance drawn a caricature, of
which there is no merit in the execution to compensate for the faults
of the design. Lord Chesterfield, though also a political opponent,
has done Lord Hardwicke more justice.—See Miscell. Works, vol.
iv. p. 51. Admitting many of his eminent qualities, he elegantly
says of his avarice, that though it was his ruling passion, he
never was in the least suspected of any kind of corruption; a
rare and meritorious instance of virtue and self-denial, under the
influence of such a craving, insatiable, and increasing passion.—See
also Lord Mahon’s Hist. vol. iii. p. 201. The Editor has
only further to observe, that none but a lawyer who has practised
in the Court where Lord Hardwicke so long presided, can correctly
appreciate his discharge of the duties of that high office.
His judgments maintain their authority to the present hour, and
furnish the earliest and clearest exposition of the principles of

every part of his judicial career.—E.</p></div>

adding, that from being sensible of the impropriety of going abroad

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_453" href="#FNanchor_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> The book displays cleverness rather than “<em>great parts</em>.” D’Eon
was an unprincipled coxcomb, bold, ready, and plausible; with a
smattering of literature, and more than common powers of writing.
At the outset of the dispute he was not much in the wrong, for the
difficulties raised to the payment of his disbursements as Minister
were ungenerous, if not unjust; and M. Guerchy’s lamentations over
the guinea per month lavishly expended in English Gazettes would
have put the forbearance of most men to a severe test. In his passion
D’Eon forgot the laws of decency as well as of honour, and the publication
of his book injured him certainly not less than his enemies. It
had an immense circulation, and the attempts to suppress it at Paris,
of course, served to make it more sought after. Lord Holland, who
happened to be there at that time, used to lend his copy by the hour.
A reply to D’Eon was published, under the title of “Examen des
Lettres, &amp;c. du Chevalier d’Eon, dans une Lettre à M. N—” and is
smart enough. The Critical Review (1764) treats it as a satisfactory
refutation of D’Eon’s charges; but the public continued to laugh at the
French Ambassador and his Government, and they fell in general
estimation fully to the extent stated in the text.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_454" href="#FNanchor_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> Walpole’s hatred of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke may be traced in
this portrait of his son. Lord Hardwicke was one of the best informed
noblemen of his day. The Athenian Letters which he wrote,
in conjunction with his brother, whilst at the University, ranks next
to the Travels of Anacharsis among works of its kind. “The Correspondence
of Sir Dudley Carleton” is more curious than interesting;
and the editor seems to have correctly appreciated it, by restricting
his first edition to twenty copies, and his second to fifty. Perhaps
there was some ostentation in terming the next impression a third
edition. He is entitled to more credit for his State Papers, published
in two volumes, quarto,—a work of value, and which still fully maintains
its consideration. Lord Hardwicke’s health was very delicate,
and he neither liked nor shone in general society, but he did not want
decision of character, and had a strong sense of honour. He was firm
in his political connections, and exemplary in private life. A biographical
account of him is given in Cole’s MSS. in the British Museum,
Donation, 5886.—E.</p></div>

opposite creed. He afterwards formed one of the party that went
under the name of the King’s friends, a political section which can
hardly be said to have existed in preceding reigns, and which the
personal character of George the Third rendered very influential on
public measures. A more valuable recruit could not easily have been
found. He was certainly a most able parliamentary lawyer, and the
exactness and precision that characterised his mind, caused his opinion
to be always depended upon. These qualities, added to his discretion,
gave him a moral influence over the House which could not be the
result of his political conduct. His manners were obliging, and his
private life irreproachable. It is highly to his credit that, when Clerk

[As he was brother in-law to General Conway, Mr. Walpole seems
to have expected him to have followed Conway’s politics.—Mr. Croker’s
note to the fourth volume of Walpole’s Letters, p. 369. Wraxall says
of him, “Devoid of shining talents, he nevertheless wanted not either
ability or eloquence in a certain degree, both which were under the
control of reason and temper. His figure and deportment were remarkably
graceful.” He married the Dowager Countess Ferrers, sister
of Sir William Meredith, and died at an advanced age in 1816.—E.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_472" href="#FNanchor_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> Lord Hertford could not reasonably be expected to court a share
in the consequences of an act of which he disapproved: and he was of
a temperament that too easily disposed him to shrink from any personal
sacrifice. His political principles were very indefinite. His merit was
of a different character. Lord Chesterfield was sincere when he said
of him, in a letter not intended for publication, “I verily believe he will
please as Viceroy, for he is one of the honestest and most religious men
in the kingdom, and moreover very much of a gentleman in his behaviour
to everybody.”—His administration of Ireland was respectable,
and in general approved of, and it passed away in almost uniform
tranquillity.—Hardy’s Life of Lord Charlemont, vol. i. p. 224. He
filled many high offices, and was very prosperous throughout life. He
was created Marquis in 1793, and died in the following year, leaving
a large family.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_475" href="#FNanchor_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> Conway conducted himself less well than Wolfe at Rochfort, but
far better than the other generals. “Though eminently distinguished
for his gallant and indefatigable behaviour,” says Walpole, “he never
had the happiness of achieving any action of remarkable éclât, or of
performing <em>alone</em> any act of singular utility to his country. However,
he had been engaged in six regular battles, besides smaller affairs.”—(Counter
Address to the Public on the Dismissal of a late General.)
He commanded a division with credit in the Seven years’ war. An ill-natured
cotemporary critic charges him with being a “<em>martinet</em>,” and
with unnecessarily fatiguing his men, but admits that “he would have
made a very good general if he had not been spoilt by his education
under the Duke of Cumberland.” Life of Lord Chatham, Ap. vol. iii.

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_484" href="#FNanchor_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> Charles sixth Earl and first Marquis of Drogheda, K.P.—The
Primate had four years before importunately pressed Mr. Pitt to give
this nobleman the rank of colonel; and although the application was
supported by the Duke of Devonshire and Lord Besborough, Mr. Pitt
was firm in resisting it. “Among the very many lieutenant-colonels,”
he said, “above Lord Drogheda on the list, there were not a few
who could not be postponed without great hardship, and loud complaints
in the army. He had publicly pledged himself to that most
meritorious class of officers, that he would never contribute, from any
considerations of family or parliamentary interest, to their depression.”
The Primate’s letter and Mr. Pitt’s reply are given in the Chatham
Correspondence, vol. ii. p. 59. The transaction reflects great honour
on Mr. Pitt, and furnishes an additional proof of the high sense of public
duty entertained by that illustrious statesman, in this, as in many
other respects so superior, to most of his cotemporaries, not excepting
the Primate of Ireland. Lord Drogheda obtained his rank in 1762,
and eventually reached almost the head of the army list, having in his
old age been appointed Field-Marshal. He died at Dublin in December
1821, in his ninety-second year. He saw little, if any, foreign service,
but he had been constantly employed in his own country, where
he was much esteemed. He preserved to the last a remarkable elegance
and amiability of deportment.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_485" href="#FNanchor_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> It must be recollected, that Walpole, from some private cause,
bore Lord and Lady Northumberland no good will, and frequently
sneers at them in his Correspondence. A childish feeling of envy at
Lord Northumberland’s brilliant success in life, was probably at the
bottom of this, and prevented Walpole’s making due allowance for the
temptations attendant on great and unexpected prosperity. His
Lordship had the tastes that became the high rank to which he was
elevated. He patronized the arts, and was generous to men of letters.
His vanity was unaccompanied by arrogance, and his feelings, though
not warm, were kind and amiable. Neither his talents nor acquirements
were above mediocrity. He died in 1786.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_486" href="#FNanchor_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> The Duchess’s defects are, no doubt, greatly exaggerated by
Walpole. M. Dutens says of her Grace, that “she possessed great
elevation of mind, natural and easy wit, a good and compassionate
heart, and, above all, a strong attachment to her friends, whom she
took every opportunity to distinguish and to serve.”—Memoirs of a
Traveller, &amp;c., vol. ii. p. 100. She met her death, which was sudden,
with great firmness and resignation.—E.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_487" href="#FNanchor_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> The marriage was unfortunate, and dissolved in 1779. Lord
Warkworth became Duke of Northumberland in 1786. He served
as Lord Percy in the American war. Unlike his father, he was totally
devoid of ostentation, and most simple and retiring in his habits. He
died in 1817.—E.</p></div>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
